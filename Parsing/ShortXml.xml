'''April''' is the fourth [[month]] of the [[year]], and comes between [[March]] and [[May]]. It has 30 [[day]]s. April begins on the same day of week as [[July]] in all years and also [[January]] in leap years.

April's [[flower]]s are the [[Sweet Pea]] and [[Asteraceae|Daisy]]. Its [[birthstone]] is the [[diamond]]. The meaning of the diamond is innocence.

== The Month ==
[[File:Colorful spring garden.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Spring]] flowers in April in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].]]
April comes between [[March]] and [[May]], making it the fourth month of the year. It also comes first in the year out of the four months that have 30 days, as [[June]], [[September]] and [[November]] are later in the year. It starts on the same day of the week as [[July]] every year, and starts on the same day as [[January]] in [[leap year]]s. In a [[common year]], April starts on the same day of the week as [[October]] of the previous year, and in [[leap year]]s starts on the same day as [[May]] of the previous year.
April ends on the same day of the week as [[December]] every year. In a [[common year]], it ends on the same day as [[July]] of the previous year. In a [[leap year]], it ends on the same day as [[October]] of the previous year.

April is a [[spring]] month in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and an [[autumn|autumn/fall]] month in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. In each [[hemisphere]], it is the [[season]]al equivalent of [[October]] in the other.

It is unclear as to where April got its name. A common theory is that it comes from the [[Latin]] word &quot;aperire&quot;, meaning &quot;to open&quot;, referring to [[flower]]s opening in [[spring]]. Another theory is that the name could come from [[Aphrodite]], the Greek goddess of [[love]]. It was originally the second month in the old Roman [[Calendar]], before the start of the new year was put to [[January 1]].

Quite a few festivals are held in this month. In many [[Southeast Asia]]n cultures, new year is celebrated in this month. In Western [[Christianity]], [[Easter]] can be celebrated on a [[Sunday]] between [[March 22]] and [[April 25]]. In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christianity, it can fall between [[April 4]] and [[May 8]]. At the end of the month, Central and Northern [[Europe]]an [[culture]]s celebrate [[Walpurgis Night]] on [[April 30]], marking the transition from [[winter]] into [[summer]].

== April in poetry ==
[[poetry|Poets]] use ''April'' to mean the end of winter. For example: ''April showers bring [[May]] flowers.''

'''August''' is the eighth [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], coming between [[July]] and [[September]]. It has 31 [[day]]s, the same number of days as the previous month, [[July]], and is named after Roman Emperor [[Augustus Caesar]].

== The Month ==
[[File:Hw-augustus.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Roman Emperor [[Augustus Caesar]], after whom August is named]]
This month was first called ''[[Sextilis]]'' in [[Latin]], because it was the sixth month in the old [[Roman calendar]]. The Roman calendar began in March about 735 BC with [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]]. [[October]] was the eighth month. August was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700 BC. Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the [[decemvirs]] about 450 BC (Roman writers disagree). In [[153 BC]] [[January 1]] was determined as the beginning of the year.

August is named for [[Augustus Caesar]] who became [[Roman consul]] in this month.&lt;ref name=&quot;infoplease&quot;&gt;{{Citation |title=History of August |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/history-of-august.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The month has 31 days because [[Julius Caesar]] added two days when he created the [[Julian calendar]] in [[45 BC]]. August is after July and before September.

August, in either [[hemisphere]], is the seasonal equivalent of [[February]] in the other. In the [[Northern hemisphere]] it is a [[summer]] month and it is a [[winter]] month in the [[Southern hemisphere]]. In a [[common year]], no other month begins on the same day of the week as August, though in [[leap year]]s, [[February]] starts on the same day as August. August always ends on the same day of the week as [[November]].

August's flower is the [[Gladiolus]] with the birthstone being [[peridot]]. The astrological signs for August are Leo ([[July 24]] - [[August 22]]) and Virgo ([[August 23]] - [[September 23]]).

'''Art''' is an activity or creation by people that has importance because of an attraction to the human [[senses]]. Art is made when a human expresses himself or herself. Some art is useful in a practical sense, such as a sculptured clay [[bowl]] that one can put things in. Many people disagree on how to define art. Many people say people are driven to make art due to their inner [[creativity]]. Art includes [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpting]], [[photography]], [[Performing arts|performance art]], [[dance]], [[music]], [[poetry]], [[prose]] and [[theatre]].

== Types of art ==
Art is divided into the [[plastic arts]], where something is made, and the [[performing arts]], where something is done by humans in action. The other division is between pure arts, done for themselves, and practical arts, done for a practical purpose, but with artistic content.
*Plastic arts
**Fine art is expression by making something [[Beauty|beautiful]] or appealing to the [[emotion]]s by visual means: [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[printmaking]] [[sculpture]]
**Literature: [[poetry]], creative [[writing]]
*Performing arts
**Performing Art including [[drama]] are (expression using the body: [[dance]], [[acting]], [[singing]])
**Auditory art (expression by making [[sound]]s): [[music]], [[singing]]
*Practical arts
** Culinary art (expression by making [[flavor]]s and [[taste]]s): [[cooking]] 
** The practical Arts (expression by making things and structures: [[architecture]], [[Movie|filming]], [[fashion]], [[photography]], [[video games]])

== What &quot;Art&quot; Means ==
Some people say that art is a product or item that is made with the intention of stimulating the human senses as well as the human mind or spirit.

An artwork is normally judged by how much impact it has on people, the amount of people who can relate to it, and how much people appreciate it.

The first and broadest sense of &quot;art&quot; means &quot;arrangement&quot; or &quot;to arrange.&quot; In this sense, art is created when someone arranges things found in the world into a new or different design or form; or when someone arranges colors next to each other in a painting to make an image or just to make a pretty or interesting design.

Art can also be a form of expression of emotion. The artist may feel a certain emotion and feels there is no other way to express it than to create something that means something to them. Most of the art created in this case is made for the artist rather than an audience. Though if an audience is able to connect with the emotion as well, then the art work will become publicly successful.

== History of art ==

There are sculptures, [[cave painting]] and [[rock art]] dating from the Upper [[Paleolithic]] era.

All of the great ancient civilizations, such as Ancient [[Egypt]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Greece]], [[Rome]] or [[Arabia]] had works and styles of art. In the [[Middle Ages]], most of the art in [[Europe]] showed people from the [[Bible]] in [[painting]]s, [[stained glass]] windows, and [[mosaic]] tile floors and walls.

[[Islamic]] art includes [[geometric]] patterns, Islamic [[calligraphy]], and [[architecture]]. In [[India]] and [[Tibet]], painted sculptures, dance, and religious painting were done. In China, arts included [[jade]] carving, bronzework, [[pottery]], [[poetry]], calligraphy, music, painting, drama, and fiction. There are many Chinese artistic styles, which are usually named after the ruling dynasty.

In Europe, after the [[Middle Ages]], there was a &quot;[[Renaissance]]&quot; which means &quot;rebirth&quot;. People rediscovered [[science]] and artists were allowed to paint subjects other than religious subjects. People like [[Michelangelo]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] still painted religious pictures, but they also now could paint mythological pictures too. These artists also invented [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] where things in the distance look smaller than things close up in the picture. This was new because in the Middle Ages people would paint all the figures close up and just overlapping each other.

In the late 1800s, artists in Europe, responding to [[Industrialization|Modernity]] created many new painting styles such as [[Classicism]], [[Romanticism]], [[Realism]], and [[Impressionism]]. The history of twentieth century art includes [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dada]]ism, [[Surrealism]], and [[Minimalism]].

== Roles of art ==

In some [[society|societies]], people think that art belongs to the person who made it, such as Indigenous Aboriginal Australian Art. They think that the artist put his or her &quot;[[talent]]&quot; into the art. In this view, the art is the [[property]] of the artist.

In other societies, people think that art belongs to no one. They think that society has put its [[social capital]] into the artist and the artist's work. In this view, society is a [[collective]] that has made the art, through the artist.

=== Functions of art ===

The [[wikt:simple:function|functions]] of art include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bagdasaryan |first=Nadejda |title=Culturology |year=2000 |language=Russian |ISBN=5-06-003475-5 |pages=511 |chapter=7. Art as a phenomenon of culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1) Cognitive Function

:Works of art let us know about what the author knew, and about what the surrounding of the author were like.

2) Aesthetic Function

:Works of art are more or less harmonic and bring pleasure, a sensation of beauty.

3) Prognostic Function

:Some artists draw what they see the future like, and some of them are right, but most are not...

4) Recreation Function

:Art makes us think about it, not about reality; we have a rest.

5) Value Function

:What did the artist value? What aims did he like/dislike in human activity? This usually is clearly seen in artists' works.

6) Didactic Function

:What message, criticism or political change did the artist wish to achieve?

: ''This page is about the first [[letter]] in the [[alphabet]].
: ''For the indefinite article, see [[Article (grammar)]].''
: ''For other uses of A, see [[A (disambiguation)]]''

{{A-Z}}
[[File:A cursiva.gif|thumb]]
'''A''' is the first letter of the [[English language|English]] [[alphabet]]. The small letter, '''a''', is used as a lower case [[vowel]]. However, the English long '''a''' (ā) is said as a [[diphthong]] of ĕ and y. The same letter of the [[Greek alphabet]] is named [[alpha (letter)|alpha]]. Alpha and [[omega (letter)|omega]], the last letter of the Greek alphabet, means the beginning and the end. In [[musical notation]], the letter A is the symbol of a note in the scale, below [[B]] and above [[G]]. In [[binary]] numbers, the letter A is 01000001.

A is the letter that was used to represent a team in an old [[TV]] show, [[The A-Team]].

==Where it came from==
The earliest the letter 'A' has appeared was in the Phoenician alphabet's [[aleph]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; This symbol came from a simple picture of an [[ox]] head. 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- style=&quot;background-color:#EEEEEE; text-align:center;&quot;
! Egyptian
! Phoenician &lt;br&gt;''[[aleph]]''
! Greek &lt;br&gt;''[[Alpha (letter)|Alpha]]''
! Etruscan &lt;br&gt;A
! Roman/Cyrillic &lt;br&gt;A
|- style=&quot;background-color:white; text-align:center;&quot;
|[[File:EgyptianA-01.svg|Egyptian hieroglyphic ox head]]
|[[File:PhoenicianA-01.svg|Phoenician aleph]]
|[[File:Alpha uc lc.svg|65px|Greek alpha]]
|[[File:EtruscanA.svg|Etruscan A]]
|[[File:RomanA-01.svg|Roman A]]
|}

This Phoenician letter helped make the basic blocks of later types of the letter. The Greeks later modified this letter and used it as their letter [[Alpha (letter)|alpha]]. The Greek alphabet was used by the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscans]] in nothern Italy, and the Romans later modified the Etruscan alphabet for their own language.

==Using the letter==
The letter A has six different sounds. It can sound like æ, in the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], such as the word ''pad''. Other sounds of this letter are in the words ''father'', which developed into another sound, such as in the word ''ace''.

==Use in mathematics==
In algebra, the letter &quot;A&quot; along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities.

In geometry, capital A, B, C etc. are used to label [[line segment]]s, [[Line (geomotry)|lines]], etc. Also, A is typically used as one of the letters to label an angle in a triangle

[[Image:Kawasaki-Electric Fan.jpg|thumb|A [[wikt:fan|fan]] is used to move air]]

'''Air''' is the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]]. Air around us is a mixture of many gases and dust particles. It is the clear [[gas]] in which living things live and [[breathe]]. It has an indefinite shape and volume. It has no [[color]] or [[odor|smell]]. It has [[mass]] and [[weight]]. It is a [[matter]] as it has mass and weight. Air creates [[atmosphere pressure]]. There is no air in the [[vacuum]] and [[cosmos]]. 

Air is a [[mixture]] of 78.09% [[nitrogen]], 20.95% [[oxygen]], 0.93% [[argon]], 0.039% [[carbon dioxide]], and small amounts of other gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://mistupid.com/chemistry/aircomp.htm|title=composition of air}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zimmer, Carl (3 October 2013). Earth’s Oxygen: a mystery easy to take for granted. New York Times. [http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/science/earths-oxygen-a-mystery-easy-to-take-for-granted.html?_r=0]&lt;/ref&gt;  There is an average of about 1% water vapour.

Animals need the [[oxygen]] in the air to live. In the [[human body]], the [[lung]]s give oxygen to the [[blood]], and give back [[carbon dioxide]] to the air. Plants need the carbon dioxide in the air to live. They give off oxygen that humans can breathe again.  

[[Wind]] is moving air.  Air [[air pollution|can be polluted]] by some gases (such as [[ozone]] and [[carbon monoxide]]), [[smoke]], and [[ash]]. This [[pollution]] is one of the [[cause]]s of [[global warming]], by causing the &quot;[[greenhouse effect]]&quot;.

Aircraft use [[propeller]]s to move air over a [[wing]], which allows them to [[flight|fly]].

'''Administrators''', also called '''admins''' or '''sysops''' ('''sys'''tem '''op'''erators), are users who can use special [[Special:ListGroupRights/Admin|tools]] that help keep Wikipedia running smoothly.  They can use these tools because they are trusted by the community, but this does not make them better or more important than anybody else.  The opinion of an administrator, for example, should not be counted as more important than the opinion of a person who chooses to change Wikipedia with an IP address just because they have administrator rights.

''There are currently {{NUMBEROFADMINS}} administrators.''

=== Administrative tools ===
==== Delete ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy|delete]] and undelete pages. Pages can be deleted because of a [[WP:RFD|request for deletion]] or they can be [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy#Quick deletion|quickly deleted]] under policy. Undeletion requests should be made at [[Wikipedia:Requests for undeletion]].

=====Revision Delete=====
Administrators can also hide [[Help:Diff|revisions]] of a page from public view by deleting them. Only other administrators can see the deleted revisions. Revisions should only be hidden in special cases, listed [[Wikipedia:Deletion_policy#Revision deletion|here]].

==== Protect ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Protection policy|protect]], unprotect and change protected pages, including those in the [[:en:Wikipedia:MediaWiki namespace|MediaWiki namespace]], and other users' personal [[Javascript]] or [[CSS]] (.js or .css) files.
* Requests for protection can be made at [[Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard]]. Please remember that pages are usually protected when there is [[WP:VAND|vandalism]] or an [[WP:edit war|edit war]] happening, and not to prevent vandalism that has not happened.

==== Block ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Blocks and bans|block]] and unblock users who are causing trouble.
* Requests should be made at [[Wikipedia:Vandalism in progress]] but only if the user has been disruptive.  Requests made in [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|bad faith]] may result in you yourself being blocked. Blocks are different to bans.

==== Rollback ====
They can [[Wikipedia:Rollback|rollback changes]]. This lets them quickly undo all the changes by a user to a page if they are the newest changes. The change is automatically marked as a [[Help:small change|small change]] and gives the following [[WP:Change summary|change summary]]:

:'''m''' ''Reverted edits by '''User A''' ('''talk''') to last version by '''User B'''

To use bot rollback, you type in the URL &lt;nowiki&gt;http://simple.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=Example&amp;bot=1  &lt;/nowiki&gt; replacing Example with the user name, and then you can rollback changes and hide them from the recent changes along with the rolled back edit, but this should only be used for large amounts of vandalism, like with a [[:m:vandalbot|vandalbot]].
* Users can also be given the rollback tool. You can make requests at [[WP:RFRB|requests for rollback]].

==== Import pages ====
They can [[meta:Import|import]] pages from other Wikipedias.

==== View unwatched pages ====
They can see which pages are not on someone's watchlist.

==== Manage userrights ====
They can give some user rights to others. They can add or remove rollback, IP block exempt, the flood flag and the patroller right for all accounts.

== Bureaucrat ==
{{shortcut|[[WP:CRAT]]&lt;br&gt;[[WP:BUR]]}}
A '''bureaucrat''' can do a few more things than an administrator, but they should only use these while acting on [[WP:CON|consensus]]. Bureaucrats can give administrator or bureaucrat rights to other users, following a successful request on [[Wikipedia:Requests for permissions]]. On the Simple English Wikipedia bureaucrats can also remove administrator status following a successful request for removal of rights (deadminship), or in certain emergency situations for protection of the wiki. They can also &quot;flag&quot; and un-flag [[Wikipedia:Bot|bots]], which means to hide their contributions from the new changes and put them in the bot group. Bureaucrats were previously able to help users who want to [[:meta:Changing username|change their username]]. These requests were handled on [[Wikipedia:Changing username]]. However, the ability to rename users has been removed from bureaucrats for [[:m:SUL finalization|SUL finalization]]. Now, these requests should be made at [[:m:SRUC|Meta-Wiki]] or on this [[Special:GlobalRenameRequest|special page]] where stewards and global renamers will handle them.

== CheckUser ==
A select few administrators have checkuser access. They can see the [[IP address]]es of named editors. They can also see which users edit from certain IP addresses, as well as some information on the [[browser]] used for editing. There are many rules as to who can become a CheckUser, and how CheckUsers have to behave. These rules are listed on the [[m:CheckUser policy|CheckUser policy]] page. CheckUsers can help fight [[vandalism]] and [[WP:Sock puppetry|sock puppetry]] this way. CheckUser requests can be made at [[Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser]].

== Oversighter ==
Certain administrators have oversighter access. Page [[:en:Help:Diff|revisions]] can be hidden or removed from the public history so they can only be seen by other oversighters and [[:m:System administrators|developers]]. The right is a sensitive one, and removes private data that can cause legal problems. There are many rules as to who can become an oversighter, and how oversighters have to behave. These rules are listed on the [[m:Oversight|Oversighter policy]] page. Oversighters can help fight [[wp:VAN|vandalism]] this way. Oversighter requests should only be made privately, and not on Wikipedia. See the [[WP:OS|Oversighter]] page.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Spain]] is divided in 17 parts called '''autonomous communities'''. ''Autonomous'' means that each of these autonomous communities has its own Executive Power, its own Legislative Power and its own Judicial Power. These are similar, but NOT the same, to states in the [[United States]] of America, for example.

Spain has fifty smaller parts called provinces. In [[1978]] these parts came together, making the autonomous communities. 
Before then, some of these provinces were together but were broken. The groups that were together once before are called &quot;historic communities&quot;: Catalonia, Basque Country, Galicia and Andalusia.

The Spanish language is the official language in every autonomous commmunity but six, which also have other official languages:
* [[Catalonia]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Occitan language|Occitan]])
* [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencian Community]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]], also called [[Valencian language|Valencian]] there)
* [[Balearic Islands]] ([[Catalan language|Catalan]])
* [[Galicia]] ([[Galician language|Galician]])
* [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] ([[Basque language|Basque]])
* [[Navarre]] ([[basque language|Basque]], but only in the north and near the border with Euskadi)

List of the autonomous communities, with their Capital city (the place where the government has its offices):

* [[Andalusia]] (its capital is [[Sevilla]])
* [[Aragon]] (its capital is [[Zaragoza]])
* [[Asturias]] (its capital is [[Oviedo]])
* [[Balearic Islands]] (its capital is [[Palma de Mallorca]])
* [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] (its capital is [[Vitoria]])
* [[Canary Islands]] (they have two capitals - [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] and [[Santa Cruz de Tenerife]])
* [[Cantabria]] (its capital is [[Santander]])
* [[Castile-La Mancha]] (its capital is [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]])
* [[Castile and León]] (its capital is [[Valladolid]])
* [[Catalonia]] (its capital is [[Barcelona]])
* [[Extremadura]] (its capital is [[Mérida]])
* [[Galicia]] (its capital is [[Santiago de Compostela]])
* [[La Rioja]] (its capital is [[Logroño]])
* [[Community of Madrid]] (its capital is [[Madrid]])
* [[Region of Murcia]] (its capital is [[Murcia]])
* [[Navarre]] (its capital is [[Pamplona]])
* [[Valencia (autonomous community)|Valencian Community]] (its capital is [[Valencia]])

Spain also has two cities on the north coast of Africa: [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]. They are called &quot;autonomous cities&quot; and have simultaneously the majority of the power of an autonomous community and also power of provinces and power of municipalities.

'''Alan Mathison Turing''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] [[FRS]] ([[London]], 23 June 1912 – [[Wilmslow]], [[Cheshire]], 7 June 1954) was an [[English people|English]] [[mathematician]] and [[computer scientist]]. He was born in [[Maida Vale]], London.&lt;ref&gt;Newman M.H.A. 1955. Alan Mathison Turing. 1912–1954. ''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society'' '''1''': 253. [http://rsbm.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/1/253]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Turing was one of the people who worked on the first [[computers]]. He was the first person to think of using a computer to do things that were too hard for a person to do. He created the [[Turing machine]] in 1936. The machine was [[Imagination|imaginary]], but it included the idea of a [[computer program]]. 

Turing was interested in [[artificial intelligence]]. He proposed the [[Turing test]], to say when a machine could be called &quot;intelligent&quot;. A computer could be said to &quot;think&quot; if a human talking with it could not tell it was a machine.&lt;ref&gt;Harnad, Stevan 2008.  [http://eprints.ecs.soton.ac.uk/7741 The Annotation game: Turing (1950) on Computing, machinery and intelligence]. In: Epstein, Robert &amp; Peters, Grace (eds) ''Parsing the Turing Test: philosophical and methodological issues in the quest for the thinking computer''. Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[World War II]], Turing worked to break [[Germany|German]] [[cipher]]s (secret messages). Using [[cryptanalysis]] he helped to break the codes of the [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] machine. After that, he solved other German codes.

From 1945 to 1947, Turing worked on the design of the [[ACE (computer)|ACE]] (Automatic Computing Engine) at the [[National Physical Laboratory]]. He presented a paper on 19 February 1946. That paper was &quot;the first detailed design of a [[stored-program computer]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Copeland, B. Jack 2006. ''Colossus: The secrets of Bletchley Park's code-breaking computers''. Oxford University Press. p108 ISBN 978-0-19-284055-4&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was possible to build ACE, there were delays in starting the project. In late 1947 he returned to Cambridge for a sabbatical year. While he was at Cambridge, the [[Pilot ACE]] was built without him. It ran its first program on 10&amp;nbsp;May 1950.

== Private life ==
Turing was a [[homosexual]] man. In 1952, he admitted having had sex with a man in [[England]]. At that time, [[homosexual]] acts were illegal. Turing was [[conviction|convicted]]. He had to choose between going to [[jail]] and taking [[hormone]]s to lower his sex drive. He decided to take the hormones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letters of Note: Yours in distress, Alan |last=Turing |first=Alan |year=1952 |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/yours-in-distress-alan.html |archivedate=December 16, 2012 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6CxLiSeL9}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his punishment, he became [[erectile dysfunction|impotent]]. He also grew [[breast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Alan Turing: The Enigma The Centenary Edition | publisher=Princeton University | author=Andrew Hodges | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, a [[private member's bill]] was put before the [[House of Lords]] to grant Turing a statutory [[pardon]].&lt;ref name=Guardian-Pardon&gt;{{cite web|title=Parliamentary bill launched for Alan Turing pardon|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/the-northerner/2012/jul/25/alan-turing-private-members-bill-lord-sharkey|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=25 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2013, the government supported it.&lt;ref name=turingguardian19july2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk-news/2013/jul/19/enigma-codebreaker-alan-turing-posthumous-pardon|title=Enigma codebreaker Alan Turing to be given posthumous pardon|publisher=The Guardian|date=19 July 2013|author=Nicholas Watt}}&lt;/ref&gt; A royal pardon was granted on 24&lt;!-- Mercy is effective from 24 December although it was announced on the night of 23rd --&gt; December 2013.&lt;ref name=turingindependent24dec2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/alan-turing-gets-his-royal-pardon-for-gross-indecency--61-years-after-he-poisoned-himself-9023116.html|title=Alan Turing gets his royal pardon for 'gross indecency' – 61 years after he poisoned himself|publisher=The Independent|date=23 December 2013|Author=Oliver Wright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=turingpardoncryptome24dec2013&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/2013/12/turing-pardon.pdf|title=(Archived copy of) Royal Pardon for Alan Turing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death ==
In 1954, after suffering for two years, Turing died from [[cyanide]] poisoning. The cyanide came from either an [[apple]] which was poisoned with [[cyanide]], or from water that had cyanide in it. The reason for the confusion is that the police never tested the apple for cyanide.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, Andrew 1983. ''Alan Turing: the enigma''. London: Burnett Books, p488. ISBN 0-04-510060-8&lt;/ref&gt; 

The treatment forced on him is now believed to be very wrong. It is against [[medical ethics]] and international laws of [[human rights]]. In August 2009, a [[petition]] asking the [[British Government]] to apologise to Turing for punishing him for being a homosexual was started.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Thousands call for Turing apology |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8226509.stm |publisher=BBC News  |date=31&amp;nbsp;August 2009 |accessdate=31 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Petition seeks apology for Enigma code-breaker Turing | url = http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/europe/09/01/alan.turing.petition/index.html | publisher=CNN | date = 01&amp;nbsp;September 2009 | accessdate =1 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The petition received thousands of signatures.&lt;ref&gt;The petition was only open to UK citizens.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Gordon Brown]] acknowledged the petition. He called Turing's treatment &quot;appalling&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = PM's apology to codebreaker Alan Turing: we were inhumane | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/sep/11/pm-apology-to-alan-turing | publisher=The Guardian| date = 11 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alanis Nadine Morissette''' (born 1 June 1974) is a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]]-winning [[Canada|Canadian]]-[[Americans|American]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ([http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/alanismorissette/articles/story/7000077/in_brief_alanis_jlo &quot;In Brief: Alanis, J.Lo: Alanis gets American citizenship, J.Lo loses European tour&quot;]), [[16 February]] [[2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; [[singer]] and [[songwriter]]. She was born in [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]]. She began singing in Canada as a teenager in [[1990]]. In [[1995]], she became popular all over the world.

'''Andouille''' is a type of [[pork]] [[sausage]]. It is spicy (hot in taste) and smoked. There are different kinds, all with different combinations of pork [[meat]], [[fat]], [[intestines]] (tubes going to the [[stomach]]), and [[tripe]] (the wall of the stomach). Andouille sausage first came from [[France]] or [[Germany]] (no-one is sure), but the name indicates that it may have come out from France, and the most famous sort in the [[United States|USA]] is the &quot;Cajun&quot; style. 

Other sorts are &quot;French andouille&quot; and &quot;German andouille&quot;; they are less spicy than Cajun. Cajun has extra [[sodium chloride|salt]], [[black pepper]], and [[garlic]]. Andouille makers smoke the sausages over pecan wood and sugar cane for a maximum of seven or eight hours, at about 175 degrees Fahrenheit (80 degrees Celsius).

'''Farming''' is growing [[crop]]s or keeping animals by people for [[food]] and [[raw material]]s. Farming is a part of [[agriculture]].

== History ==
Agriculture started at least 10,000 years ago, but no one knows for sure how old it is.&lt;ref&gt;Colin Tudge argues &quot;from at least 40,000 years ago... people were managing their environment to such an extent that they can properly be called 'proto-farmers'&quot;. Tudge, Colin 1998. ''Neanderthals, bandits and farmers: how agriculture really began''. London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, p3. ISBN 0-297-84256-7&lt;/ref&gt; The development of farming gave rise to the [[Neolithic Revolution]] whereby people gave up [[nomad]]ic [[hunting]] and settled in what became [[cities]].

Agriculture and [[domestication]] probably started in the [[Fertile Crescent]] (the [[Nile]] Valley, The [[Levant]] and [[Mesopotamia]]).&lt;ref&gt;Harris, David (ed) 1996. ''The origins and spread of agriculture and pastoralism in [[Eurasia]]: crops, fields, flocks and herds''. UCL Press. ISBN 1-56098-675-1&lt;/ref&gt; The area called Fertile Crescent is now in the countries of [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Turkey]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Israel]], and [[Egypt]]. [[Wheat]] and [[barley]] are some of the first crops people grew. People probably started agriculture slowly by planting a few crops, but still gathered many foods from the wild. People may have started farming because the weather and soil began to change. Farming can feed many more people than [[hunter-gatherer]]s can feed on the same amount of land.

== Overview ==
Agriculture is not only growing food for people and animals, but also growing other things like [[flower]]s and [[nursery]] [[plant]]s, manure or dung, [[animal hides]] (skins or furs), [[leather]], animals, fungi, [[fiber]]s ([[cotton]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], and [[flax]]), [[biofuel]]s , and [[drug]]s (bio[[pharmaceuticals]], [[marijuana]], [[opium]])

Many people live by doing what is called [[subsistence agriculture]], on a small farm. Only the farmer's family lives on the farm. Subsistence agriculture is growing only enough food to feed the farmer, his family, and his animals. Extra food or animals are sold for money or other things the farmer cannot grow. The [[yield]] is the amount of food grown on a given amount of land, and the yield is often low. This is because subsistence farmers are generally less [[education|educated]], and they have less [[money]] to buy equipment. When yields are low, [[forests]] are sometimes cut to provide new land to grow more food. This is good in the [[short term]], but can be bad for the country and the surrounding environment over many years.

In rich countries, farms are often much larger. The yield on farms has got bigger in the last one hundred years because farmers are able to grow better [[variety (botany)|varieties]] of plants, use more fertilizer, use more water, and more easily control weeds and pests. Many farms also use machines, which cut down on the number of people needed to farm the land. There are fewer farmers in rich countries, but the farmers are able to grow more. 

This kind of [[intensive agriculture]] comes with its own set of problems. Farmers use a lot of chemical fertilizers, [[pesticide]]s (chemicals that kill bugs), and [[herbicide]]s (chemicals that kill weeds). These chemicals can [[pollute]] the [[soil]] or the water. They can also create bugs and weeds that are more resistant to the chemicals, causing outbreaks of these pests. The soil can be damaged by [[erosion]] (blowing or washing away), salt buildup, or loss of structure. [[Irrigation]] (adding water from rivers) can pollute water and lower the water table. These problems have all got solutions, and modern young farmers usually have a good technical education.

=== Agriculture techniques ===
* [[Fertilizer]]s
* [[Crop rotation]]
* [[Weed]] removal
* [[Breeding]]
* [[Agricultural fencing|Fencing]]
* [[Ranching]]

Farmers select plants with better yield, taste, and [[nutrition]]al value. They also choose plants that are more resistant to disease, more tolerant to drought, and easier to harvest. Centuries of careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. The crops produce better yield with other techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, irrigation).

Some companies have been searching for new plants in poor countries, and genetically modify these plants to improve them. They then try to patent the seeds and sell them back to the poor countries.

New plants were created with [[genetic engineering]]. One example of [[genetic engineering]] is modifying a plant to resist an herbicide.

== Food ==
It is important for there to be enough food for everyone. The food must also be safe and good. They say it is sometimes not safe, because it contains some chemicals. Other people say intensive agriculture is damaging the environment. For this reason, there are several types of agriculture.

Traditional agriculture is mostly done in poor countries.

Intensive agriculture is mostly done in wealthier countries. It uses pesticides, machinery, chemical fertilizers. Organic farming is using only natural products. Integrated farming is using local resources, and trying to use the waste from one process as a resource in another process.

[[Agricultural policy]] focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production. At the policy level, common goals of agriculture include:

* [[Food safety]]: to be sure that the food supply is safe.
* [[Food security]]: to be sure there is enough food for everyone.
* [[Food quality]]: to be sure the food is of good quality.

== Problems in agriculture ==
There are some serious problems that face people trying to grow food today.
These include:
* [[Erosion]]
* [[Diseases]]
* [[Pests]]
* [[Weed]]s
* [[Drought]]
* [[Rainfall]]

== Crops ==
The major crops produced in the world in 2002, are maize (corn), wheat, rice, and cotton.

*[[Maize]] 624 millions of metric tons
*[[Wheat]] 570 millions of metric tons
*[[Rice]] 381.1 millions of metric tons
*[[Cotton]] 96.5 millions of metric tons

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Arithmetic''' is a name for working with [[number]]s. It is a part of [[mathematics]]. The four basic arithmetic operations are [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[multiplication]], and [[Division (mathematics)|division]].

Harder arithmetic includes working with [[signed number]]s, [[Fraction (mathematics)|fractions]], and [[decimal]]s, and taking [[power (math)|powers]] and [[root (math)|roots]].

Most people learn arithmetic in [[primary school]], but some people do not learn arithmetic and others forget the arithmetic they learned. Many jobs require a knowledge of arithmetic, and many employers complain that it is hard to find people who know enough arithmetic. A few of the many jobs that require arithmetic include [[carpenter]]s, [[plumber]]s, [[automobile mechanic|auto mechanics]], [[accountant]]s, [[architect]]s, [[Medical doctor|doctors]], and [[nurse]]s. Arithmetic is needed in all areas of mathematics, [[science]], and [[engineering]]. 

A [[calculator]] can be used to do arithmetic. [[Computer]]s can do it more quickly, which is one reason [[Global Positioning System]] receivers have a small computer inside. 

== Examples of arithmetic ==

* 2 + 3 = 5 (adding is [[commutative property|commutative]]: 2 + 3 is the same as 3 + 2)

* 7 - 5 = 2 (subtracting is not commutative: 7 - 5 is different from 5 - 7)

* 3 * 4 = 12 (multiplying is commutative: 3 * 4 is the same as 4 * 3)

* 6 / 2 = 3 (dividing is not commutative: 6 / 2 is different from 2 / 6)

[[Image:Addition.gif|thumb|220px|Addition ]]

'''Addition''' is the [[mathematics|mathematical]] way of putting things together.

== Arithmetic ==

In [[arithmetic]], addition is finding the total of two or more [[number]]s. The sign for addition is &quot;+&quot;. The name for the sign &quot;+&quot; is &quot;plus&quot;.  
Another name for the total is the [[sum]].

=== Counting examples ===
For example, there are [[wikt:object|objects]] in two [[group]]s. The objects are small circles: &quot;o&quot;. One group has five of these objects. The other group has 3 of these objects. To find the total number of objects in both groups, the objects can be counted. Another way to find the number of objects in both groups is to add the numbers in each group.  

====Adding====

Another method is to add the numbers of objects in group A and group B, since they are already counted. In symbols:

:{{math|5 + 3}}

There are [[rule]]s for adding numbers that people [[learn]]. There are also rules for adding numbers that are built into machines ([[binary adder]]). The rule says that:

:{{math|{{aao|5|3|+}}}}

In another counting example, Sally and Bill have 2 children. Sally and Bill get 3 more children. Sally and Bill have added three children to their two children and now have five children.

'''Vertical Addition'''

The animation above demonstrates the addition of seven hundred and eighty six and four hundred and sixty seven, the problems digits have been separated into units, tens and hundreds ([[place value]]).  First the units 6 and 7 are added together to make 13, so 1 ten and 3 units, the 3 is written below and the 1 ten is carried to the tens column. Next in the tens column the 1, 8 and 6 are added together to make 15 tens, so 1 hundred and 5 tens, the 5 is written below and the 1 hundred is carried to the hundreds column. Finally in the hundreds column 1, 7 and 4 are added together to make 12 hundreds, so 1 thousand and 2 hundreds, the 2 is written below and the 1 thousand is carried to the thousand column. Giving the answer one thousand two hundred and fifty three.

===A measurement example===
Tom wants to know the distance between his house and Sally's house. Bob's house is 300 meters  east of Tom's house. Sally's house is 120 meters east of Bob's house:

:Tom's house&lt;------------300 meters--------------&gt;Bob's house&lt;-----120 meters-----&gt;Sally's house

The distance from Tom's house to Sally's house can be found by adding the distances already measured. The distance from Tom's house to Bob's house added to the distance from Bob's house to Sally's house is the same as the distance from Tom's house to Sally's house. That is, three hundred (300) meters plus 120 meters.

== Addition as increase ==
Addition can also mean to make bigger.

=== Example of addition as increase ===
* For example, Tom has a house. Tom puts a new room on the house. This new room is called an addition.

* John is making [[food]]. To make the food [[taste]] better, John puts [[salt]] in the food. That is, John adds salt to the food. The [[salt]] is a [[food additive]] or addition to the food.

'''Australia''' is a [[country]] in the [[Southern hemisphere]] between the [[Pacific Ocean]] and the [[Indian Ocean]].  Its official name is the '''Commonwealth of Australia'''. Australia is the sixth biggest country in the world by landmass, and is part of the [[Oceania|Oceanic]] and [[Australasia]]n regions. The Australian [[emblem]] is a flower called the Golden Wattle. 

23{{ndash}}24 million people live in Australia, and about 80% of them live on the east coast. About 60% live in and around the mainland state capitals of [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] and [[Adelaide]]. Australia's capital city is [[Canberra]].

Australia is known for its [[mining]] and for its production of [[wool]]. Australia is the world's largest producer of [[bauxite]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mams.rmit.edu.au/0wzm6liriybr1.PDF|title=Alcola World Alumina Australia|publisher=MAMS.RMIT.edu.au|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia, [[New Zealand]], [[New Guinea]] and other islands on the Australian [[tectonic plate]] are together called [[Australasia]]. They form one of the world's great [[ecozone]]s. When other Pacific islands are included, the term is [[Oceania]].

== Geography ==
[[File:As-map.png|thumbnail|left|Map of Australia]]
Australia's landmass of 7,617,930 square kilometers is on the Indo-Australian plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Turner | first=Kate | year=2008 | title=National Geographic Australia | publisher=Horupu | location=Tokyo | page=pp.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The continent of Australia, including the island of Tasmania, was separated from the other continents of the world many millions of years ago. Because of this, many [[animals]] and [[plants]] live in Australia that do not live anywhere else. These include animals like the [[kangaroo]], the [[koala]], the [[emu]], the [[kookaburra]], and the [[platypus]].

People first arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago. These native Australians are called the [[Australian Aborigine]]s. For the history of Australia, see [[History of Australia]].

Most of the Australian colonies, having been settled from [[Britain]], became mostly independent democratic states in the 1850s and all six combined as a federation on [[1 January]] [[1901]]. The first [[Prime Minister of Australia]] was [[Edmund Barton]] in [[1901]]. Australia is a member of the [[United Nations]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]]. It is a [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] with [[Queen Elizabeth II|Elizabeth II]] as Queen of Australia and Head of State and a [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] who is chosen by the Prime Minister to carry out all the duties of the Queen in Australia.

=== Regions and cities ===
{{Other pages|List of Cities in Australia}}
Australia has six states, two major mainland territories, and other minor territories. The states are [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]], [[South Australia]], [[Tasmania]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], and [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Cummins | first=Brian R. | year=1990 | title=Australia | publisher= the Australian Government Publishing Service | location=Canberra | pages= 16-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two major mainland territories are the [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]] (ACT).

In 2013 according to world bank Australia had just over 23.13 million people. Most Australians live in cities along the coast, such as [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Darwin, Australia|Darwin]], [[Hobart]] and [[Adelaide]]. The largest inland city is [[Canberra]], which is also the nation's capital. The largest city is Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Oceania South Pole | author= Tanabe Yu | year= 1997 | publisher= Asakura Bookstore | location= Shinjyuku ward | page= 3179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia is a very big country, but much of the land is very dry, and the middle of the continent is mostly [[desert]]. Only the areas around the east, west and south coast have enough rain and a suitable [[climate]] (not too hot) for many [[farm]]s and [[cities]].

== History ==
=== Aboriginal people ===
[[File:Corroboree.jpg|thumb|Photograph of Arrernte men of Central Australia in a [[Corroboree]] in 1900.]]

The [[Australian Aborigine|Australian Aboriginal]] people arrived in Australia more than 50,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The history of Australia |author=Takao Fujikawa |year=2004|publisher=Yuhikaku ARMA |location=Tokyo |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until the arrival of British settlers in 1788, the Aboriginal people lived by hunting and gathering food from the land. They lived in all sorts of climates and managed the land in different ways. An example of Aboriginal land management was the Cumberland Plain where Sydney is now. Every few years the Aboriginal people would burn the grass and small trees.{{Citation}} This meant that a lot of grass grew back, but not many big trees. Kangaroos like to live on grassy plains, but not in forests. The kangaroos that lived on the plain were a good food supply for the Aboriginal people. Sometimes, Aborigines would name a person after an animal, and they could not eat that animal to help level out the food population.

Aboriginal people did not usually build houses, except huts of grass, leaves and bark. They did not usually build walls or fences, and there were no horses, cows or sheep in Australia that needed to be kept in pens. The only Aboriginal buildings that are known are fish-traps made from stones piled up in the river, and the remains of a few stone huts in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] and [[Tasmania]].{{Citation}} The Aboriginal people did not use metal or make pottery or use bows and arrows or weave cloth. In some parts of Australia the people used sharp flaked-stone spearheads, but most Aboriginal spears were made of sharply pointed wood. Australia has a lot of trees that have very hard wood that was good for spear making. The [[boomerang]] was used in some areas for sport and for hunting.

The Aboriginal people did not think that the land belonged to them. They believed that they had grown from the land, so it was like their mother, and they belonged to the land.

=== Terra Australis ===
In the 1600s, [[Dutch people|Dutch]] merchants traded with the islands of [[Batavia]] (now [[Indonesia]]), to the north of Australia and several different Dutch ships touched on the coast of Australia. The Dutch Governor, van Diemen, sent [[Abel Tasman]] on a voyage of discovery and he found [[Tasmania]], which he named [[Van Diemen's Land]]. Its name was later changed to honour the man who discovered it.

The [[British Government]] were sure that there must be a very large land in the south, that had not been explored. They sent Captain [[James Cook]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]]. His ship, ''[[HMS Endeavour]]'', carried the famous scientists, Sir [[Joseph Banks]] and Dr Solander who were going to [[Tahiti]] where they would watch the planet [[Venus (planet)|Venus]] pass in front of the [[Sun]]. Captain Cook's secret mission was to find &quot;Terra Australis&quot; (the Land of the South).

The voyage of discovery was very successful, because they found [[New Zealand]] and sailed right around it. Then they sailed westward. At last, a boy, William Hicks, who was up the mast spotted land on the [[horizon]]. Captain Cook named that bit of land [[Point Hicks]]. They sailed up the coast and Captain Cook named the land that he saw &quot;New South Wales&quot;. At last they sailed into a large open bay which was full of fish and stingrays which the sailors speared for food. Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander went ashore and were astonished to find that they did not know what any of the plants or birds or animals that they saw were. They collected hundreds of plants to take back to England.

Captain Cook saw the Aboriginal people with their simple way of life. He saw them fishing and hunting and collecting grass seeds and fruit. But there were no houses and no fences. In most parts of the world, people put up a house and a fence or some marker to show that they own the land. But the Aboriginal people did not own the land in that way. They belonged to the land, like a baby belongs to its mother. Captain Cook went home to England and told the Government that no-one owned the land. This would later cause a terrible problem for the Aboriginal people.

=== Settlement ===
[[File:The Founding of Australia. By Capt. Arthur Phillip R.N. Sydney Cove, Jan. 26th 1788.jpg|thumb|Captain [[Arthur Phillip]] raises the British flag at [[Sydney]] in 1788.]]

In the 1700s, in England, laws were tough, many people were poor and [[gaol]]s ([[jail]]s) were full. A person could be sentenced to death for stealing a loaf of bread. Many people were hanged for small crimes. But usually they were just thrown in gaol. Often they were sent away to the British Colonies in America. But in the 1770s, the colonies in America became the United States. They were free from British rule and would not take England's convicts any more.

By the 1780s the gaols of England were so full that convicts were often chained up in rotting old ships. The Government decided to make a settlement in New South Wales and send some of the convicts there. In 1788 the [[First Fleet]] of eleven ships set sail from [[Portsmouth]] carrying convicts, sailors, marines, a few free settlers and enough food to last for two years. Their leader was Captain [[Arthur Phillip]]. They were to make a new colony at the place that Captain Cook had discovered, named Botany Bay because of all the unknown plants found there by the two scientists.

Captain Phillip found that [[Botany Bay]] was flat and windy. There was not much fresh water. He went with two ships up the coast and sailed into a great harbour which he said was &quot;the finest harbour in the world!&quot; There were many small bays on the harbour so he decided on one which had a good stream of fresh water and some flat shore to land on. On the 26th January, [[1788]], the flag was raised and New South Wales was claimed in the name of King George III of England, and the new settlement was called Sydney.

For the first few years of the settlement, things were very difficult. No-one in the British Government had thought very hard about what sort of convicts should be sent to make a new colony. Nobody had chosen them carefully. There was only one man who was a farmer. There was no-one among the convicts who was a builder, a brickmaker or a blacksmith. No-one knew how to fix the tools when they broke. The cattle all escaped. There were no cooking pots. All the plants were different so no-one knew which ones could be eaten. There was a grave danger that everyone in the new colony would die of starvation.

Somehow, the little group of tents with a hut for the Governor, Arthur Phillip, and another hut for the supply of food, grew into a small town with streets, a bridge over the stream, a windmill for grinding grain and wharves for ships. By the 1820s there was a fine brick house for the Governor. There was also a hospital and a convict barracks and a beautiful church which are still standing today. Settlements had spread out from Sydney, firstly to [[Norfolk Island]] and to [[Van Diemen's Land]] (Tasmania), and also up the coast to Newcastle, where coal was discovered, and inland where the missing cattle were found to have grown to a large herd. Spanish Merino sheep had been brought to Sydney, and by 1820, farmers were raising fat lambs for meat and also sending fine wool back to the factories of England.

While the settlement was growing in New South Wales, it was also growing in Tasmania. The climate in Tasmania was more like that in England, and farmers found it easy to grow crops there.

=== Exploration ===
[[File:Ln-Governor-Lachlan macquarie.jpg|thumb|Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]] was the 5th [[Governor of New South Wales]] and one who though that Australia could be a rich and free place.]]

Because Australia is such a very large land, it was easy to think that it might be able to hold a very large number of people. In the early days of the colony, a great number of explorers went out, searching for good land to settle on.
When the settlers looked west from Sydney, they saw a range of mountains which they called the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]]. They were not very high and did not look very rugged but for many years no-one could find their way through them. In 1813 [[Gregory Blaxland]], [[William Lawson (explorer)|William Lawson]] and a 17 year-old called [[William Charles Wentworth]] crossed the Blue Mountains and found land on the other side which was good for farming. A road was built and the Governor, [[Lachlan Macquarie]] founded the town of [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] on the other side, 100&amp;nbsp;miles from Sydney.

Some people, like Captain [[Charles Sturt]] were sure that there must be a sea in the middle of Australia and set out to find it. Many of the explorers did not prepare very well, or else they went out to explore at the hottest time of year. Some died like Burke and Wills. [[Ludwig Leichhardt]] got lost twice. The second time, he was never seen again. Major [[Thomas Mitchell]] was one of the most successful explorers. He mapped the country as he went, and his maps remained in use for more than 100 years. He travelled all the way to what is now western Victoria, and to his surprise and annoyance found that he was not the first white person there. The Henty brothers had come from [[Tasmania]], had built themselves a house, had a successful farm and fed the Major and his men on roast lamb and wine.

===Self government===

The goldrushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold. The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry. By 1853 the goldrushes had made some poor people, very rich.

The transportation of convicts to Australia ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came. The people in Australia wanted to run their own country, and not be told what to do from London. The first governments in the colonies were run by Governors chosen by London. Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy. [[William Wentworth]] started the Australian Patriotic Association (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand [[Parliamentary democracy|democratic government]]. In 1840, the city councils started and some people could vote. [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] had its first elections in 1843, again with some limits on who could vote. In 1855, limited self-government was given by London to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. In 1855, the [[right to vote]] was given to all men over 21 in [[South Australia]]. The other colonies soon followed. Women were given the vote in the [[Parliament of South Australia]] in 1895 and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;aec.gov.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm |title=AEC.gov.au |publisher=AEC.gov.au |date=25 Oct. 2007 |accessdate=27 Jun. 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=8 Documenting Democracy] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/60vtMmmE7|date =2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australians had started parliamentary democracries all across the continent. But voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament.

=== The Commonwealth of Australia ===

Until 1901, Australia was not a [[nation]], it was six separate [[colony|colonies]] governed by Britain. They voted to join together to form one new country, called the Commonwealth of Australia, in 1901. Australia was still part of the British Empire, and at first wanted only British or Europeans to come to Australia. But soon it had its own money, and its own Army and Navy.

In Australia at this time, the [[trade union]]s were very strong, and they started a political party, the [[Australian Labor Party]]. Australia passed many laws to help the [[worker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/wright.htm Women and the Right to Vote in Australia - Australian Electoral Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, the [[World War I|First World War]] started in Europe. Australia joined in on the side of Britain against [[Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Turkey]]. Australian soldiers were sent to [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]], in Turkey. They fought bravely, but were beaten by the Turks. Today Australia remembers this battle every year on [[ANZAC Day]]. They also fought on the [[Western Front]]. More than 60,000 Australians were killed.

Australia had a really hard time in the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s and joined Britain in a war against [[Nazi Germany]] when Hitler invaded Poland in 1939. But in 1941 lots of Australian soldiers were captured in the [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore|Fall of Singapore]] by Japan. Then Japan started attacking Australia and people worried about invasion. But with help from the [[United States Navy]], the Japanese were stopped. After the war, Australia became a close friend of the United States.

When the war ended, Australia felt that it needed many more people to fill the country up and to work. So the government said it would take in people from Europe who had lost their homes in the war. It did things like build the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme]]. Over the next 25 years, millions of people came to Australia. They came especially from [[Italy]] and [[Greece]], other countries in Europe. Later they also came from countries like [[Turkey]] and [[Lebanon]]. An important new party, the [[Liberal Party (Australia)|Liberal Party of Australia]] was made by [[Robert Menzies]] in 1944 and it won lots of elections from 1949 until in 1972, then [[Gough Whitlam]] won for the Labor Party. Whitlam made changes, but he made the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] unhappy and the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] sacked him and forced an election in 1975. Then [[Malcolm Fraser]] won a few elections for the Liberal Party.

In the 1960s many people began coming to Australia from [[China]], [[Vietnam]], [[Malaysia]] and other countries in [[Asia]]. Australia became more [[multicultural]]. In the 1950s and 1960s Australia became one of the richest countries in the world, helped by mining and wool. Australia started trading more with America, then Japan. Australia supported the United States in wars against [[dictatorship]]s in [[Korea]] and [[Vietnam]] and later [[Iraq]]. Australian soldiers also helped the [[United Nations]] in countries like [[East Timor]] in 1999.

In 1973, the famous [[Sydney Opera House]] opened. In the 1970s, 80s and 90s lots of [[Australian cinema|Australian movies]], actors and [[Australian music|singers]] became famous around the world. In the year 2000, [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney had the Summer Olympics]].

In the 1980s and 90s, the Labor Party under [[Bob Hawke]] and [[Paul Keating]], then the Liberal Party under [[John Howard]] made lots of changes to the economy. Australia had a bad [[recession]] in 1991, but when other Western countries [[Global financial crisis of September–October 2008|had trouble with their economies in 2008]], Australia stayed strong.

Today Australia is a rich, peaceful and democratic country. But it still has problems. Around 4-5% of Australians could not get a job in 2010. A lot of land in Australia (like [[Uluru]]) has been returned to Aboriginal people, but lots of Aborigines are still poorer than everybody else. Every year the government chooses a big number of new people from all around the world to come as [[immigrant]]s to live in  Australia. These people may come because they want to do business, or to live in a democracy, to join their family, or because they are [[refugee]]s. Australia took 6.5 million immigrants in the 60 years after [[World War Two]], including around 660,000 refugees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html Australia in Brief: Australia - an overview - Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julia Gillard]] became the first woman [[Prime Minister of Australia]] in 2010 when she replaced her colleague [[Kevin Rudd]] of the Labor Party.

== Politics ==
[[File:Australian house of representatives04.jpg|thumb|left|The chamber of the [[Australian House of Representatives]] in [[Canberra]].]]

Australia is made up of six [[state]]s and three mainland [[wikt:territory|territories]]. Each state and territory has its own [[Parliament]] and makes its own local [[law]]s. The [[Parliament of Australia]] sits in Canberra and makes laws for the whole country, also known as the Commonwealth or [[Federation]].

The [[Federation|Federal]] government is led by the [[Prime Minister of Australia]], who is the member of Parliament chosen as leader. The current Prime Minister is [[Tony Abbott]].

The leader of Australia is the Prime Minister, although the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] represents the Queen of Australia, who is also the Queen of Great Britain, as head of state. The Governor-General, currently, Her Excellency Ms [[Quentin Bryce]], is chosen by the Prime Minister.

== Culture ==
[[File:Sydney Opera House Night.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;The [[Sydney Opera House]] was officially opened in 1973.]]

Australia was [[Colonisation|colonised]] by people from [[Britain]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A New History of Australia |authors=Takao Fujikawa |year=2004 |publisher=ARMA |location=Tokyo |page=pp. 40 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but today people from all over the world live there. English is the main spoken language, and Christianity is the main religion though all religions are accepted and not everybody has a religion. Australia is [[multiculturalism|multicultural]], which means that all its people are helped to keep their different languages, religions and ways of life, while also learning [[English language|English]] and joining in with other Australians.

Famous [[Australian literature|Australian writers]] include the bush balladeers [[Banjo Paterson]] and [[Henry Lawson]] who wrote about life in the Australian bush. More modern famous writers include [[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]], [[Thomas Keneally]] and [[Colleen McCullough]]. In 1973, [[Patrick White]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], the only Australian to have achieved this; he is seen as one of the great English-language writers of the twentieth century.

[[Australian music]] has had lots of world-wide stars, for example the opera singers [[Nellie Melba]] and [[Joan Sutherland]], the rock and roll bands [[Bee Gees]], [[AC/DC]] and [[INXS]], the folk-rocker [[Paul Kelly (musician)]], the pop singer [[Kylie Minogue]] and [[Australian country music]] stars [[Slim Dusty]] and John Williamson. [[Australian Aboriginal music]] is very special and very ancient: it has the famous [[digeridoo]] woodwind instrument. [[File:didgeridoo.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;|[[didgeridoo]]]]

Australian TV has produced many successful programs for home and overseas - including [[Skippy the Bush Kangaroo]], [[Home and Away]] and [[Neighbours]] - and produced such well known TV stars as [[Barry Humphries]] (''Dame Edna Everage''), [[Steve Irwin]] (''The Crocodile Hunter'') and [[The Wiggles]]. Major Australian subgroups such as the Bogan have been shown on Australian TV in shows such as [[Bogan Hunters]] and Kath &amp; Kim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/our-fascination-with-bogans-will-be-televised-25262 |title=&quot;Our fascination with &quot;Bogans&quot; will be televised&quot; |publisher=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |last=Smith |first=Michelle |date=4 April 2014 |accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia has two public broadcasters (the ABC and the multi-cultural SBS), three commercial television networks, three pay-TV services, and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations. Each major city has its daily newspapers, and there are two national daily newspapers, The Australian and The Australian Financial Review.

[[Australian cinema|Australian movies]] have a very long history. The world's first feature movie was the Australian movie ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'' of 1906.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/story-kelly-gang Video Overview The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906) on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1933, ''[[In the Wake of the Bounty]]'', directed by Charles Chauvel, had [[Errol Flynn]] as the main actor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/wake-bounty/ Video Overview In the Wake of the Bounty (1933) on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online]&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn went on to a celebrated career in Hollywood. The first Australian Oscar was won by 1942's ''[[Kokoda Front Line!]]'', directed by [[Ken G. Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/newsreels/kokoda-front-line/ Video Overview Kokoda Front Line! (1942) on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s and 1980s lots of big Australian movies and movie stars became world famous with movies like ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'', [[Gallipoli (1981 movie)|''Gallipoli'']] (with [[Mel Gibson]]), ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 movie)|The Man From Snowy River]]'' and ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/film/Croc.html &quot;Fair Dinkum Fillums&quot;: the Crocodile Dundee Phenomenon]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russell Crowe]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Heath Ledger]] became global stars during the 1990s and ''[[Australia (2008 movie)|Australia]]'' starring [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Hugh Jackman]] made a lot of money in 2008.

=== Sport ===
[[File:DonaldBradman.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Don Bradman]].]]

Sport is an important part of Australian culture because the climate is good for outdoor activities. 23.5% Australians over the age of 15 regularly take part in organised sporting activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndca.asn.au/other-information/about-australia/|title=About Australia|publisher=NDCA|accessdate=2013-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In international sports, Australia has very strong teams in [[cricket]], [[hockey]], [[netball]], [[rugby league]] and [[rugby union]], and performs well in [[cycling]], [[rowing]] and swimming. Local popular sports include [[Australian Rules Football]], horse racing, soccer and motor racing. Australia has participated in every summer [[Olympic Games]] since 1896, and every [[Commonwealth Games]]. Australia has hosted the [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]] and [[2000 Summer Olympics]], and has ranked in the top five medal-winners since 2000. Australia has also hosted the 1938, 1962, 1982 and 2006 Commonwealth Games. Other major international events held regularly in Australia include the Australian Open, one of the four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, annual international cricket matches and the Formula One Australian Grand Prix. Corporate and government sponsorship of many sports and elite athletes is common in Australia. Televised sport is popular; some of the highest-rated television programs include the Summer Olympic Games and the grand finals of local and international football competitions.

The main sporting leagues for males are the [[Australian Football League]], [[National Rugby League]], [[A-League]] and [[National Basketball League (Australasia)|NBL]].
For women, they are [[ANZ Netball Championships]], [[W-League (Australia)|W-League]] and [[WNBL]].

Famous Australian [[sports]] players include the [[cricket]]er Sir [[Donald Bradman]], the [[swimming|swimmer]] [[Ian Thorpe]] and the [[Sportsperson|athlete]] [[Cathy Freeman]].

=== Art festivals ===

Just 60 years ago, Australia had only one big Art festival. Now Australia has hundreds of smaller community-based festivals, and national and regional festivals that focus on specific art forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/arts_festivals.html | title=Art festivals | author=Australian government | accessdate=15 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wildlife ==
Australia is home to many animals that can be found nowhere else on Earth, which include: the [[koala]], the [[kangaroo]], the [[wombat]], the [[numbat]], the [[emu]], among many others...[[File:Numbat.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;|[[Numbat]]]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''American English''' or '''United States English''' is the [[dialect]] of [[English language]] spoken in the [[United States]]. It is different in some ways from other variations of English, such as [[British English]]. Historically, many types of American English can be found in old local dialects of England.

Many people today know about American English even if they live in a country where another form of English is spoken. This is partly because people hear and read American English via the [[mass media|media]], for example [[CNN]] television, and the [[Internet]], where the most common form of English is American English.

Because people all over the world use American English as well as other versions of English the English language can add new words. English has been changing for centuries, adding new words to its [[vocabulary]]. For example, the English language spoken in [[India]], which has more than one billion people, will add more American English words to go along with its British English base and many other words adopted into English usage in India from any of the 200+ Indian languages.

Sometimes people will learn American English as it is spoken in America. For example, in telephone call centers in India and other places, people often learn American English in order to sound more like their customers who call India from America. These people often continue to use American English in everyday life.

Many word definitions are different in American English. Most changes in a language start with small things. For instance [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[French language|French]] all came from [[Latin]].

==Spelling in American English==
There are many words that sound the same between American English and British English, but are spelled differently.  For example:

*Words originally from the French that end in &quot;-our&quot; in British English (behaviour, colour, honour, neighbour, etc.) end in &quot;-or&quot; in American English (behavior, color, honor, neighbor). 
&lt;br/&gt;Words of French origin that end in -re in British English (metre, centre) end in -er in American English. In these cases [[Canadian]] usage is to keep the British (and French) spelling.
*Verbs that end in -ise in British English (criticise, realise) end in -ize in American English (criticize, organize, realize). However, the -ize ending is optional in British English, and is shown as an alternative in British dictionaries.
*One of the changes introduced by Noah Webster is the change of the double &quot;l&quot; from words like &quot;travelled&quot; to &quot;traveled&quot;. 

Many of these differences can be traced to the works of Anglophobe [[Noah Webster]], who produced the American dictionary following the [[American War of Independence]].

Some more differences in American English:
* aluminium is spelled &quot;aluminum&quot;
* doughnut is spelled &quot;donut&quot;
* draught is spelled &quot;draft&quot;
* gaol (not common) is spelled &quot;jail&quot;
* plough is spelled &quot;plow&quot;

There are also some words in American English that are a bit different from British English, e.g.:
* aeroplane is called &quot;airplane&quot;
* ladybird is called &quot;ladybug&quot;
* lift is called &quot;elevator&quot;
* toilet is called &quot;bathroom&quot;, &quot;restroom&quot; or &quot;comfort station&quot;
* lorry is called &quot;truck&quot;
* nappies are called &quot;diapers&quot;
* petrol is called &quot;gas&quot; (or &quot;gasoline&quot;)
* the boot of a car is called a &quot;trunk&quot;
* a dummy is called a &quot;pacifier&quot;
* trousers are called &quot;pants&quot;
* underground is called &quot;subway&quot;
* football is called &quot;soccer&quot;
* braces are &quot;suspenders&quot; (&quot;suspenders&quot; in British-English refers to items of apparel worn around the lower leg by males to prevent socks/sox from sagging, and around the upper leg by women wearing stockings)

'''Aquaculture''' is the [[farming]] of [[fish]], [[shrimp]], and [[algae]]. Aquaculture supplies fish, such as [[catfish]], [[salmon]], and [[trout]]. Aquaculture was developed a long time ago in [[China]] and aquaculture supplies over 20% of all the seafood harvested. However aquaculture is quite a new activity in [[Canada]] as it only began in [[1879]]. It is- in simpler terms- the farming of seafood.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''abbreviation''' is a shorter way to write a word or phrase. People use abbreviations for words that they write a lot. The [[English language]] occasionally uses the [[apostrophe]] mark ' to show that a word is written in a shorter way, but some abbreviations do not use this mark. More often, they use [[Period (punctuation)|periods]], especially the ones that come from the [[Latin]] language. Common Latin abbreviations include '''i.e.''' [id est] ''that is'', '''e.g.''' [exempli gratia] ''for example'', and '''et al.''' [et alia] ''and others''.

Some new abbreviations have been created by [[scientist]]s, by workers in companies and governments, and by people using the [[Internet]]. 

People often think words are abbreviations when in fact they are [[acronym]]s.

Here are examples of common acronyms: The word &quot;[[radar]]&quot; is an [[acronym]] for &quot;Radio Detection and Ranging&quot;. The name of the large computer company [[IBM]] comes from the words &quot;International Business Machines&quot;. The name of the part of the [[United States]] government that sends [[rocket]]s into [[outer space]] is NASA, from the words &quot;National Aeronautics and Space Administration&quot;. When people using the Internet think that something is very funny, they sometimes write &quot;LOL&quot; to mean &quot;Laughing Out Loud&quot;. People sometimes write &quot;ASAP&quot; for &quot;As Soon As Possible&quot;.

[[File:Angelsatmamre-trinity-rublev-1410.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Three angels, in a picture made in about 1420 by the Russian, Andrej Rublev.]]

In many mythologies and [[religion]]s, an '''angel''' is a good [[spirit]]. The word angel comes from the Greek word ''angelos'' which means &quot;messenger&quot;. Angels appear frequently in the [[Old Testament]], the [[New Testament]], [[Qur'an]] and [[Aqdas]].

==In the Bible==
Angels are powerful, smart spirits that obey God's commands and praise him with singing and they have [[male]] ([[masculine]])[[gender]], but without any sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|26:53}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sometimes appear to [[human]]s in human form.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Hebrews|13:2}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can deliver messages to people in person or in [[dream]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|1:20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angels that are named in the [[Bible]] are [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]] (called a &quot;chief prince&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Daniel|10}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Gabriel]] (known for telling [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] that she would be the mother of [[Jesus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|1:26-38}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and Raphael (in the [[Apocrypha]]l [[Book of Tobit]]).&lt;ref name=ABF&gt;{{cite book|title=The Amazing Bible Factbook|year=2008|publisher=American Bible Society|location=New York|isbn=1603207783|pages=4-7, 179}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Ethiopia]]n [[Book of Enoch]] also lists four Archangels which watch over the four quadrants of heaven; Michael, Raphael, Gabriel and Uriel. Lucifer is also known as an angel in the Bible. 

===Types===
*'''Cherubim''' (plural of cherub) are described as &quot;winged creatures&quot; which have four wings&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|1:6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cherubim guard the [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] with a [[sword]] of fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Genesis|3:24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that the author of Genesis was aware of different types of angels. Genesis 3:24 is found in the [[Book of Ezekiel]]. A Cherub is mentioned in Ezekiel 28:13-14, saying that the angel was in the Garden of God.&lt;ref&gt; The IVP New Bible Commentary pp734 states: ' the exact significance of the cherub is unclear'&lt;/ref&gt;

Ezekiel 28:13-14
13. Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepaired in thee in the day that thou wast created.
14. Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire.

It describes the sound of their wings, &quot;like the roar of rushing waters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezekiel|1:24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ezekiel 10:5-7 ; Ezekiel 10:8 reveals that they have hands like a man under their wings .

Ezekiel 1:7 KJV reveals that they look like man but are different because they have &quot;straight feet&quot; and four wings and four faces.

Ezekiel ch 1, and 10 describe the cherubim creatures ascending and descending from the earth with wheels. Ezekiel 1:14-20 ; Ezekiel 10:16

Ezekiel 10:9-13 describes what the wheels appeared to look like, and how they moved around, how they moved or flew through the sky quickly but turned not as they went; and how the inside workings of the wheels appeared to be &quot;a wheel in the midst of a wheel&quot; and that the color of the wheels was the color of &quot;Amber&quot; Stone. There are four separate wheels in both accounts, one for each single cherub which is there. 

*'''Seraphim''' (plural of seraph, which means &quot;burning&quot;)they also are depicted having wings, six of them. They are known for singing and praising God. They can shout so loud, they shake the [[temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Isaiah|6:4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Archangels''' like Gabriel ([[Gospel of Luke]] 1:19) are the highest type of angel. They are considered [[saint]]s in the [[Catholic church]].&lt;ref name=ABF/&gt; However, in the King James Version of the Bible; they are another type of angel. In the [[Book of Revelation]] the Angel Michael casts the 'great dragon' [[Satan]] out of heaven and down to earth in a great battle between the good and bad angels, just before the Great Judgement of angels and man. (Revelation 12)

*The [[Leviathan]] in [[Book of Job]] 41:19-21 has flame that goes:  'out of his mouth' like a [[dragon]].  Isaiah 30:6 also talks of a 'fiery flying serpent'. Compare Revelation 20:2: , where an angel: 'laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the [[Devil]], and Satan, and bound him a thousand years'.

==In art==
They are often shown in art as having wings and a [[halo]]. The wings represent their speed, and the halo represents their holiness. 

The cherubim in art always appear as baby faced angels with very small non useful wings.

The cherubim statue or [[bronze]] casting of cherubim in the Temple of [[Solomon]] depicted them as two four winged creatures whose wings touched at the peak of the ark that they were making.

The same cherubim creatures were said to be cast in gold on top of the [[Ark of the Covenant]]. Casting metal is one of the oldest forms of artwork, and was attempted by [[Leonardo Da Vinci]].

==Angelology==
The study of Angels is called Angelology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theology.edu/theology/angel.htm Angelology]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ad hominem''' is a [[Latin language|Latin]] word for a type of [[argument]]. It is a word often used in [[rhetoric]]. Rhetoric is the science of speaking well, and convincing other people of your [[idea]]s. 

Translated to English, ''ad hominem'' means ''against the person''. In other words, when someone makes an ad hominem, they are [[attack|attacking]] the person they are arguing against, instead of what they are saying.  

The term comes from the Latin word ''homo'', which means [[human]]. ''Hominem'' is a [[gender]] neutral version of the word ''homo''. In ancient [[Rome]] it referred to all free men, or in other words, all free human beings. 

Ad hominem can be a way to use [[reputation]], [[rumor|rumors]] and [[hearsay]] to change the minds of other people listening. When a [[social network]] has already excluded or exiled one person, or applied a negative [[label]] to them, this can work more often.

It is most of the time considered to be a weak and poor argument. In [[court|courts]] and in [[diplomacy]] ad hominems are not appreciated.

Ad hominems are not wrong every time. For example, when people think that someone can't be [[Trust (social sciences)|trusted]], things that they have said previously can be [[doubt|doubted]].

== What an ad hominem argument looks like ==
In [[logic]], a [[wikt:proof|proof]] is something that starts with [[premise]]s, and goes through a few logical [[argument]]s, to reach a [[conclusion]].

=== Normal (valid) proof ===
# All [[human]]s are mortal
# [[Socrates]] is a man (he is human)
# Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

=== Ad hominem example ===
# Person A thinks [[abortion]] should be [[illegal]]
# Person A is uneducated and poor
# Therefore abortion should not be illegal.

In this example it can be seen that the (completely unrelated) fact that person A is uneducated and poor is used to prove that abortion should not be illegal.

'''Native Americans''' (also '''Aboriginal Americans''', '''American Indians''', '''Amerindians''', or '''Indigenous Peoples of America''') are the people who were in [[North America]], [[Central America]], [[South America]], and the [[Caribbean]] Islands when Europeans arrived. 
[[Christopher Columbus]] was travelling west, so he thought he was going to [[India]]. This is why he called the people &quot;Indians&quot;. There are more than three million Native Americans in Canada and the U.S. combined.

Sometimes these people are called &quot;Indians&quot;, but this is confusing, because it is the same word used for people from [[India]]. There are many different [[tribe]]s of Amerindian people, with many different languages. 

Many Amerindians died after the Europeans came to the Americas, from [[disease]]s that came with the Europeans that were new to the Amerindians, in [[war]]s with the Europeans, or because the Europeans made them work as [[slave]]s. Most of the Amerindians were hurt or killed by settlers who took their lands.

The ancestors of American Indians came to the Americas from [[Asia]]. Some of them may have come to America over 12,000 years ago when [[Alaska]] was connected to [[Siberia]] by the [[Bering land bridge]].

Some Indian tribes and languages of North America are [[Cherokee]], [[Maya people|Maya]] or [[Yucatec]], [[Aztecs]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]], and [[Sioux]]. 

Some Indian tribes and languages of South America are [[Aymara people|Aymara]], [[Guaraní people|Guarani]], [[Quechua]], and [[Tupi]].

The apple is a [[Fleshy fruits#Pome|fleshy fruit]] from the apple [[tree]]. It is in the [[species]] ''Malus domestica'' in the [[rose]] family [[Rosaceae]]. The apple is one of the most [[tillage|grown]] tree fruits. It is grown in orchards.

The apple tree came from [[Central Asia]]. Its wild ancestor is still there today. There are more than 7,500 kinds of different apple trees.&lt;ref name=England/&gt;

At least 55&amp;nbsp;million [[ton]]s of apples were grown around in the world in 2005. All together, they cost about $10&amp;nbsp;billion. [[People's Republic of China|China]] produced about 35% of the world's apples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple&quot;/&gt; The [[United States]] produces more than 7.5% of the apples around the world. This makes it the second greatest producer. [[Iran]] is third, after which comes [[Turkey]], [[Russia]], [[Italy]] and [[India]].

== Botanical information ==

The apple has a small, leaf-shedding tree that grows up to 3 to 12&amp;nbsp;metres (9.8 to 39&amp;nbsp;ft) tall. The apple tree has a broad crown with thick [[twig]]s.
The [[leaf|leaves]] are [[Phyllotaxis|alternately arranged]] simple [[oval]]s. They are 5 to 12&amp;nbsp;[[centimeter|centimetres]] long and 3–6&amp;nbsp;centimetres (1.2–2.4&amp;nbsp;in) wide. It has a sharp top with a soft underside. [[Blossom]]s come out in [[spring]] at the same time that the leaves begin to bud. The [[flower]]s are white. They also have a slightly pink color. They are five [[petal]]ed, and 2.5 to 3.5&amp;nbsp;centimetres (0.98 to 1.4&amp;nbsp;in) in [[wikt:diameter|diameter]]. The fruit [[wikt:maturity|matures]] in [[autumn]]. It is usually 5 to 9&amp;nbsp;centimetres (2.0 to 3.5&amp;nbsp;in) in diameter. There are five [[carpel]]s arranged in a [[star]] in the middle of the fruit. Every carpel has one to three [[seed]]s.

=== Wild ancestors ===
The wild [[ancestor]]s of ''Malus domestica'' are ''Malus sieversii''. They grow wild in the [[mountain]]s of [[Central Asia]] in the south of [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Tajikistan]], and [[Xinjiang]], [[People's Republic of China|China]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Architecture and size relations: an essay on the apple (Malus x domestica, Rosaceae) tree&quot;/&gt; and possibly also ''Malus sylvestris''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coart&quot;/&gt; Unlike [[wikt:domestication|domesticated]] apples, their leaves become red in autumn.&lt;ref&gt;Archetti M.

==History==

The apple tree was possibly the earliest tree to be cultivated.&lt;ref name=app6/&gt; Its fruits have become better over thousands of years. It is said that [[Alexander the Great]] discovered [[wikt:small|dwarfed]] apples in [[Asia Minor]] in 300 [[BCE]]. [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] have used winter apples as an important food for thousands of years. From when [[Europe]]ans arrived, [[Argentina]] and the [[United States]] have used apples as food as well.&lt;ref name=app6&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.vegparadise.com/highestperch39.html
|title= An apple a day keeps the doctor away
|accessdate= 27 January 2008
|publisher=vegparadise.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apples were brought to [[North America]] in the 1600s. The first apple [[orchard]] on the North American continent was said to be near [[Boston]] in 1625. In the 1900s, costly fruit [[industry|industries]], where the apple was a very important species, began developing.&lt;ref name=app3/&gt;

== In culture ==
=== Germanic paganism ===
[[Image:Carl Larsson Brita as Iduna.jpg|thumb|&quot;Brita as [[Iðunn|Iduna]]&quot; (1901) by Carl Larsson]]

In [[Norse mythology]], the goddess [[Iðunn]] gives apples to the gods in ''Prose Edda'' (written in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]]) that makes them young forever. English [[wikt:scholar|scholar]] H. R. Ellis Davidson suggests that apples were related to [[religion|religious]] practices in [[Germanic paganism]]. It was from there, she claims, that [[Norse paganism]] developed. She points out that buckets of apples were discovered in the place of burial for the Oseberg [[ship]] in [[Norway]]. She also remarks that fruit and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]] (Iðunn having been described as changing into a nut in ''Skáldskaparmál'') have been discovered in the early [[grave]]s of the [[Germanic peoples]] in [[England]]. They have also been discovered somewhere else on the continent of Europe. She suggests that this may have had a [[symbol]]ic meaning. Nuts are still a symbol of [[fertility]] in Southwest England.

Sometimes apples are eaten after they are [[cooked]]. Often apples are eaten uncooked. Apples can also be made into [[drink]]s. [[Apple juice]] and apple [[cider]] are apple drinks. 

The flesh of the fruit is firm with a taste anywhere from sour to sweet. Apples used for cooking are sour, and need to be cooked with sugar, while other apples are sweet, and do not need cooking. There are some seeds at the core, that can be removed with a [[tool]] that removes the core, or by carefully using a [[knife]].

The [[scientific name]] of the apple tree genus in the [[Latin]] language is ''Malus''. Most apples that people grow are of the ''Malus domestica'' species.

Most apples are good to eat [[raw]] (not cooked), and are also used in many kinds of [[bake]]d foods, such as [[apple pie]]. Apples are cooked until they are [[wikt:soft|soft]] to make [[apple sauce]].

Apples are also made into the [[drink]]s [[apple juice]] and [[cider]]. Usually, cider contains a little [[alcohol]], about as much as [[beer]]. The regions of [[Brittany]] in [[France]] and [[Cornwall]] in [[England]] are known for their apple ciders.

If one wants to grow a certain type of apple it is not possible to do this by planting a seed from the wanted type. The seed will have [[DNA]] from the apple that the seeds came from, but it will also  have DNA from the apple flower that [[pollinate]]d the seeds, which may well be a different type. This means that the tree which would grow from planting would be a mixture of two. In order to grow a certain type of apple, a small twig, or 'scion', is cut from the tree that grows the type of apple desired, and then added on to a specially grown [[stump]] called a rootstock. The tree that grows will only create apples of the type needed.

== Apple cultivars ==

There are more than 7,500 known [[cultivar]]s of apples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elzebroek&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Elzebroek|first=A.T.G.|coauthors=Wind, K.|title=Guide to Cultivated Plants|publisher=CAB International|location=Wallingford|date=2008|page=27|isbn=1845933567|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YvU1XnUVxFQC&amp;lpg=PT39&amp;dq=apple%20cultivars%207%2C500&amp;pg=PT39#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different cultivars are available for [[temperate]] and [[subtropical]] climates.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; apple cultivars is at the National Fruit Collection in [[England]]. Most of these cultivars are grown for eating fresh (dessert apples). However, some are grown simply for cooking or making [[cider]]. Cider apples are usually too [[wikt:tart|tart]] to eat immediately. However, they give cider a rich flavor that dessert apples cannot.&lt;ref name=&quot;apples1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

== In the United Kingdom ==
In the [[United Kingdom]] there are about 3000 different types of apples. The most common apple type grown in England is the 'Bramley seedling', which is a popular cooking apple.

Apple orchards are not as common as they were in the early 1900s, when apples were rarely brought in from other countries. Organizations such as [http://www.commonground.org.uk/ Common Ground] teach people about the importance of rare and local varieties of fruit. '[[Apple Day]]' is celebrated each [[October 21]] in many countries.

== In North America ==
Many apples are grown in [[temperate]] parts of the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. In many areas where apple growing is important, people have huge celebrations:

* [[Annapolis Valley Apple Blossom Festival]] - held five days every spring (May-June) in [[Nova Scotia]]
* [[Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival]] - held six days every spring in [[Winchester, Virginia]].
* [[Washington State Apple Blossom Festival]] - held two weeks every spring (April-May) in [[Wenatchee, Washington]]

== Varieties of apples ==
[[File:Golden delicious apple.jpg|right|thumb|A Golden Delicious apple.]]
There are lots of different varieties of apples, including:

* [[Fuji (apple)]]
* [[Gala]]
* [[Golden Delicious]] (some times called a Green Delicious Apple)
* [[Granny Smith]]
* [[Jonagold]]
* [[McIntosh]]
* [[Pink Lady]]
* [[Red Delicious]]
* [[Winesap]]
* [[Cox's Orange Pippin]]

== Family ==
Apples are in the group [[Maloideae]]. It is a subfamily of the family ''[[Rosaceae]]''. They are in the same subfamily as [[pear]]s. Its family is the family of rose like plants, and roses are in the family.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Algebra''' is a part of [[mathematics]] (often called ''math'' in the [[United States]] and '''maths''' in the [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Math or Maths|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Mathematics.html|publisher=Wolfram.com|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ). It uses [[variable]]s to represent a value that is not yet known.  When an equals sign (=) is used, this is called an [[equation]].  A very simple equation using a variable is: &lt;tt&gt;2 + 3 = x&lt;/tt&gt;   In this example, &lt;tt&gt;x = 5&lt;/tt&gt;, or it could also be said, &quot;x is five&quot;.  This is called ''solving for x''.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Algebra Introduction|url=http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/introduction.html|publisher=Math Is Fun|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides equations, there are [[inequality|inequalities]] (''less than'' and ''greater than''). A special type of equation is called the function.  This is often used in making [[graph]]s.

Algebra can be used to solve real problems because the rules of algebra work in real life and numbers can be used to represent the values of real things.  [[Physics]], [[engineering]] and [[computer programming]] are areas that use algebra all the time.  It is also useful to know in [[surveying]], [[construction]] and [[business]], especially [[accounting]].

People who do algebra need to know the rules of [[number]]s and mathematic [[operation (mathematics)|operations]] used on numbers, starting with [[addition|adding]], [[subtraction|subtracting]], [[multiplication|multiplying]], and [[division (mathematics)|dividing]].  More advanced operations involve [[exponent]]s, starting with [[square (algebra)|squares]] and [[square root]]s. Many of these rules can also be used on the variables, and this is where it starts to get interesting.

Algebra was first used to solve [[algebraic equation|equations]] and inequalities. Two examples are [[linear equation]]s (the equation of a line, &lt;tt&gt;y=mx+b&lt;/tt&gt;) and [[quadratic equation]]s, which has variables that are squared (power of two, a number that is multiplied by itself, for example: &lt;tt&gt;2*2, 3*3, x*x&lt;/tt&gt;).  How to [[factorization|factor]] [[polynomial]]s is needed for quadratic equations.

== History ==
Early forms of algebra were developed by the [[Babylonian]]s and the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. However the word &quot;algebra&quot; is a [[Latin language|Latin]] form of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''Al-Jabr'' (&quot;casting&quot;) and comes from a mathematics book ''Al-Maqala fi Hisab-al Jabr wa-al-Muqabilah'', (&quot;Essay on the Computation of Casting and Equation&quot;) written in the [[9th century]] by a famous [[Iran|Persian]] mathematician, [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]], who was a [[Islam|Muslim]] born in [[Khwarizm]] in [[Uzbekistan]]. He flourished under Al-Ma'moun in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]] through 813-833 AD, and died around 840 AD. The book was brought into [[Europe]] and [[translation|translated]] into Latin in the [[12th century]]. The book was then given the name 'Algebra'. (The ending of the mathematician's name, al-Khwarizmi, was changed into a word easier to say in Latin, and became the English word ''[[algorithm]]''.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Algebra|url=http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~sxw8045/history.htm|publisher=UCS Louisiana|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Examples==

Here is a simple example of an algebra problem:

:Sue has 12 jellybeans, Ann has 24 jellybeans. They decide to share so that they have the same number of jellybeans. 

These are the steps you can use to solve the problem:

# To have the same number of jellybeans, Ann has to give some to Sue.  Let ''x'' represent the number of jellybeans Ann gives to Sue. 
# Sue's jellybeans, plus ''x'', must be the same as Ann's jellybeans minus ''x''.  This is written as: &lt;tt&gt;12 + x = 24 - x&lt;/tt&gt; 
# Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation. This gives: &lt;tt&gt;x = 12 - x&lt;/tt&gt;.  (What happens on one side of the equals sign must happen on the other side too, for the equation to still be true. So in this case when 12 was subtracted from both sides, there was a middle step of &lt;tt&gt;12 + x - 12 = 24 - x - 12&lt;/tt&gt;.  After a person is comfortable with this, the middle step is not written down.)
# Add ''x'' to both sides of the equation. This gives: &lt;tt&gt;2x = 12&lt;/tt&gt;
# Divide both sides of the equation by 2. This gives &lt;tt&gt;x = 6&lt;/tt&gt;. The answer is six.  If Ann gives Sue 6 jellybeans, they will have the same number of jellybeans.
# To check this, put 6 back into the original equation wherever ''x'' was: &lt;tt&gt;12 + 6 = 24 - 6&lt;/tt&gt;
# This gives &lt;tt&gt;18=18&lt;/tt&gt;, which is true.  They both now have 18 jellybeans.

With practice, algebra can be used when faced with a problem that is too hard to solve any other way. Problems such as building a freeway, designing a cell phone, or finding the cure for a disease all require algebra.

== Writing algebra ==
As in most parts of mathematics, adding ''z'' to ''y'' (or ''y'' plus ''z'') is written as &lt;tt&gt;y + z&lt;/tt&gt;.
Subtracting ''z'' from ''y'' (or ''y'' minus ''z'') is written as &lt;tt&gt;y − z&lt;/tt&gt;.
Dividing ''y'' by ''z'' (or ''y'' over ''z'': &lt;math&gt;y \over z&lt;/math&gt;) is written as &lt;tt&gt;y ÷ z&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;y/z&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;y/z&lt;/tt&gt; is more commonly used.

In algebra, multiplying ''y'' by ''z'' (or ''y'' times ''z'') can be written in 4 ways: &lt;tt&gt;y × z&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;y * z&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;y·z&lt;/tt&gt;, or just &lt;tt&gt;yz&lt;/tt&gt;. The multiplication symbol &quot;×&quot; is usually not used, because it looks too much like the letter x, which is often used as a variable.  Also, when multiplying a larger expression, parentheses can be used: &lt;tt&gt;y (z+1)&lt;/tt&gt;.

When we multiply a number and a letter in algebra, we write the number in front of the letter: &lt;tt&gt;5 × y = 5y&lt;/tt&gt;. When the number is 1, then the 1 is not written because 1 times any number is that number (1 × ''y'' = ''y'') and so it is not needed.

== Functions and Graphs ==
[[File:Linear equation for y=3x+1.png|thumb|Linear equation for y=3x+1]]
An important part of algebra is the study of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]], since functions often appear in equations that we are trying to solve. A function is like a box you can put a number or numbers into and get a certain number out. When using functions, [[graph]]s can be powerful tools in helping us to study the solutions to equations. 

A graph is a picture that shows all the values of the variables that make the equation or inequality true. Usually this is easy to make when there are only one or two variables. The graph is often a line, and if the line does not bend or go straight up-and-down it can be described by the basic formula &lt;tt&gt;y = mx + b&lt;/tt&gt;. The variable ''b'' is the [[y-intercept]] of the graph (where the line crosses the vertical axis) and ''m'' is the [[slope]] or steepness of the line. This formula applies to the [[Cartesian coordinate system|coordinates]] of a graph, where each point on the line is written &lt;tt&gt;(x, y)&lt;/tt&gt;.  

In some math problems like the equation for a line, there can be more than one variable (''x'' and ''y'' in this case).  To find points on the line, one variable is changed. The variable that is changed is called the &quot;independent&quot; variable.  Then the math is done to make a number. The number that is made is called the &quot;dependent&quot; variable. Most of the time the independent variable is written as ''x'' and the dependent variable is written as ''y'', for example, in &lt;tt&gt;y = 3x + 1&lt;/tt&gt;.  This is often put on a graph, using an ''x'' axis (going left and right) and a ''y'' axis (going up and down).  It can also be written in function form: &lt;tt&gt;f(x) = 3x + 1&lt;/tt&gt;.  So in this example, we could put in 5 for ''x'' and get &lt;tt&gt;y = 16&lt;/tt&gt;.  Put in 2 for ''x'' would get &lt;tt&gt;y=7&lt;/tt&gt;.  And 0 for ''x'' would get &lt;tt&gt;y=1&lt;/tt&gt;.  So there would be a line going thru the points (5,16), (2,7), and (0,1) as seen in the graph to the right.

If x has a power of 1, it is a straight line.  If it is squared or some other power, it will be curved.  If it uses an inequality (''&lt;'' or ''&gt;''), then usually part of the graph is shaded, either above or below the line.

== Rules of algebra ==
In algebra, there are a few rules that can be used for further understanding of equations. These are called the rules of algebra. While these rules may seem senseless or obvious, it is wise to understand that these properties do not hold throughout all branches of mathematics. Therefore, it will be useful to know how these axiomatic rules are declared, before taking them for granted. Before going on to the rules, reflect on two definitions that will be given.
# Opposite - the opposite of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;-a&lt;/math&gt;.
# Reciprocal - the reciprocal of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{a}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Rules ===

==== Commutative property of addition ====
'Commutative' means that a function has the same result if the numbers are swapped around. In other words, the order of the terms in an equation do not matter. When the operator of two terms is an addition, the 'commutative property of addition' is applicable. In algebraic terms, this gives &lt;math&gt;a + b = b + a&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that this does not apply for subtraction! (i.e. &lt;math&gt;a - b \ne b - a&lt;/math&gt;)

==== Commutative property of multiplication ====
When the operator of two terms is an multiplication, the 'commutative property of multiplication' is applicable. In algebraic terms, this gives &lt;math&gt;a \cdot b = b \cdot a&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that this does not apply for division! (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{b} \ne \frac{b}{a}&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;a \neq b &lt;/math&gt;)

==== Associative property of addition ====
'Associative' refers to the grouping of numbers. The associative property of addition implies that, when adding three or more terms, it doesn't matter how these terms are grouped. Algebraically, this gives &lt;math&gt;a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this does not hold for subtraction, e.g. &lt;math&gt;1 = 0 - (0 - 1) \neq (0 - 0) - 1 = -1&lt;/math&gt; (see the distributive property).

==== Associative property of multiplication ====
The associative property of multiplication implies that, when multiplying three or more terms, it doesn't matter how these terms are grouped. Algebraically, this gives &lt;math&gt;a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this does not hold for division, e.g. &lt;math&gt;2 = 1/(1/2) \neq (1/1)/2 = 1/2&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Distributive property ====
The distributive property states that the multiplication of a number by another term can be distributed. For instance: &lt;math&gt;a \cdot (b + c) = ab + ac&lt;/math&gt;. (Do ''not ''confuse this with the associative properties! For instance, &lt;math&gt;a \cdot (b + c) \ne (a \cdot b) + c&lt;/math&gt;.)

==== Additive identity property ====
'Identity' refers to the property of a number that it is equal to itself. In other words, there exists an operation of two numbers so that it equals the variable of the sum. The additive identity property states that the sum of any number and 0 is that number: &lt;math&gt;a + 0 = a&lt;/math&gt;. This also holds for subtraction: &lt;math&gt;a - 0 = a&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Multiplicative identity property ====
The multiplicative identity property states that the product of any number and 1 is that number: &lt;math&gt;a \cdot 1 = a&lt;/math&gt;. This also holds for division: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{1} = a&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Additive inverse property ====
The additive inverse property is somewhat like the opposite of the additive identity property. When an operation is the sum of a number and its opposite, and it equals 0, that operation is a valid algebraic operation. Algebraically, it states the following: &lt;math&gt;a - a = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Multiplicative inverse property ====
The multiplicative inverse property entails that when an operation is the product of a number and its reciprocal, and it equals 1, that operation is a valid algebraic operation. Algebraically, it states the following: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{a} = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Advanced Algebra==
In addition to &quot;[[elementary algebra]]&quot;, or basic algebra, there are advanced forms of algebra, taught in colleges and universities, such as [[abstract algebra]], [[linear algebra]], and [[universal algebra]]. 
This includes how to use a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] to solve many linear equations at once. ''[[Abstract algebra]]'' is the study of things that are found in equations. For example, polynomials and matrices. These things are known as algebraic structures. Understanding the properties of more complex [[algebraic structure]]s can help us solve more complex equations.

Many math problems are about physics and engineering. In many of these physics problems time is a variable. Time uses the letter ''t''. Using the basic ideas in algebra can help reduce a math problem to its simplest form making it easier to solve difficult problems. Energy is ''e'', force is ''f'', mass is ''m'', acceleration is ''a'' and speed of light is sometimes ''c''.  This is used in some famous equations, like &lt;tt&gt;f = ma&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;e=mc^2&lt;/tt&gt; (although more complex math beyond algebra was needed to come up with that last equation).

An '''atom''' is the basic unit that makes up all [[matter]]. There are many different types of atoms, each with its own name, [[mass]] and size. These different types of atoms are called [[chemical element]]s. The chemical elements are organized on the periodic table. Examples of elements are [[hydrogen]] and [[gold]]. Atoms are very small, but the exact size changes depending on the element. Atoms range from 0.1 to 0.5 [[nanometer]]s in width.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/MichaelPhillip.shtml|title=Size of an Atom}}&lt;/ref&gt; One nanometer is around 100,000 times smaller than the width of a human [[hair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1999/BrianLey.shtml|title=Diameter of a Human Hair}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes atoms impossible to see without special tools. [[Equation]]s must be used to see the way they work and how they interact with other atoms. 

Atoms come together to make [[molecule]]s or particles: for example, two hydrogen atoms and one [[oxygen]] atom combine to make a [[water]] molecule, a form of a [[chemical]] reaction. 

Atoms themselves are made up of three kinds of smaller particles, called [[proton]]s (which are positively charged), [[neutron]]s (which have no charge) and [[electron]]s (which are negatively charged). The protons and neutrons are in the middle of the atom. They are called the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. They are surrounded by a cloud of electrons which are attracted to the nucleus' positive charge.  This attraction is called [[electromagnetic]] force. 

Protons and neutrons are made up of even smaller particles called [[quark]]s. Electrons are [[elementary particle|elementary or fundamental particles]]; they cannot be split into smaller parts. 

The number of protons, neutrons and electrons an atom has determines what element it is. Hydrogen, for example, has one proton, no neutrons and one electron;  the element [[sulfur]] has 16 protons, 16 neutrons and 16 electrons.

Atoms move faster when in gas form (as they are free to move) than liquid and solid matter. In solid [[material]]s, the atoms are tightly next to each other so they [[vibration|vibrate]], but are not able to move (there is no room) as atoms in liquids do.

== History ==
The word &quot;atom&quot; comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ἀτόμος, ''[[wiktionary:indivisible|indivisible]]'', from ἀ-, ''not,'' and τόμος, ''a cut.'' The first historical mention of the word atom came from works by the Greek [[philosophy|philosopher]] Democritus, around 400 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.winneconne.k12.wi.us/ms_teachers/LENZ/history_of_atomic_theory.htm|title=History of Atomic Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atomic theory stayed as a mostly [[philosophy|philosophical]] subject, with not much actual scientific investigation or study, until the development of [[chemistry]] in the 1600s. 

In 1777 [[France|French]] chemist [[Antoine Lavoisier]] defined the term ''element'' for the first time. He said that an [[chemical element|element]] was any basic substance that could not be broken down into other substances by the methods of chemistry. Any substance that could be broken down was a ''[[Chemical compound|compound]]''.&lt;ref name=Brief&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.cerritos.edu/ladkins/a106/a%20brief%20history%20of%20the%20atom.htm|title=A Brief History of the Atom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1803, [[England|English]] philosopher [[John Dalton]] suggested that elements were tiny, solid spheres made of atoms. Dalton believed that all atoms of the same element have the same mass. He said that compounds are formed when atoms of more than one element combine. According to Dalton, in a compound, atoms of different elements always combine the same way.

In 1827, British scientist Robert Brown looked at [[pollen]] grains in water and used Dalton's atomic theory to describe patterns in the way they moved.  This was called ''Brownian Motion''. In 1905 [[Albert Einstein]] used mathematics to prove that the seemingly random movements were down to the reactions of atoms, and by doing so he conclusively proved the existence of the atom.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~nd/surprise_95/journal/vol4/ykl/report.html|title=Brownian motion - a history}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1869 scientist [[Dmitri Mendeleev]] published the first version of the [[periodic table]]. The periodic table groups atoms by their [[atomic number]] (how many [[proton]]s they have. This is usually the same as the number of [[electron]]s). 
Elements in the same column, or period, usually have similar properties. For example [[helium]], [[neon]], [[argon]], [[krypton]] and [[xenon]] are all in the same column and have very similar properties. All these elements are [[gas]]es that have no colour and no smell. Together they are known as the [[noble gas]]es.&lt;ref name=Brief /&gt;

The physicist [[J.J. Thomson]] was the first man to discover electrons. This happened while he was working with [[cathode ray]]s in 1897. He realized they had a negative [[electric charge|charge]], unlike protons (positive) and neutrons (no charge). Thomson created the [[plum pudding model]], which stated that an atom was like plum pudding: the dried fruit (electrons) were stuck in a mass of pudding (protons). In 1909, a scientist named [[Ernest Rutherford]] used the [[Geiger–Marsden experiment]] to prove that most of an atom is in a very small space called the [[atomic nucleus]]. Rutherford took a photo plate and surrounded it with gold foil, and then shot alpha particles at it. Many of the particles went through the gold foil, which proved that atoms are mostly empty space. Electrons are so small they make up only 1% of an atom's [[mass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://ion.elte.hu/~akos/orak/atfsz/atom/rutherford_atom11.pdf|title=Ernest Rutherford on Nuclear spin and Alpha Particle interaction.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Ernest Rutherford LOC.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Ernest Rutherford]]

In 1913, [[Niels Bohr]] introduced the [[Bohr model]]. This model showed that electrons orbit the nucleus in fixed circular orbits. This was more accurate than the Rutherford model. However, it was still not completely right. Improvements to the Bohr model have been made since it was first introduced.

In 1925, chemist [[Frederick Soddy]] found that some elements in the periodic table had more than one kind of atom.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1921/soddy-bio.html|title=Frederick Soddy, the Nobel Prize in chemistry: 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For example any atom with 2 protons should be a [[helium]] atom. Usually, a helium [[Nucleus (physics)|nucleus]] also contains two neutrons. However, some helium atoms have only one neutron. This means they are still helium, as the element is defined by the number of protons, but they are not normal helium either. Soddy called an atom like this, with a different number of neutrons, an ''[[isotope]]''. To get the name of the isotope we look at how many protons and neutrons it has in its [[Nucleus (physics)|nucleus]] and add this to the name of the element. So a helium atom with two protons and one neutron is called helium-3, and a carbon atom with six protons and six neutrons is called carbon-12. However, when he developed his theory Soddy could not be certain neutrons actually existed. To prove they were real, physicist James Chadwick and a team of others created the [[mass spectrometer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1935/chadwick-lecture.html|title=James Chadwick: The Nobel Prize in Physics 1935, a lecture on the Neutron and its properties}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mass spectrometer actually measures the mass and weight of individual atoms. By doing this Chadwick proved that to account for all the weight of the atom, neutrons must exist. 

In 1937, [[Germany|German]] chemist [[Otto Hahn]] became the first person to create [[nuclear fission]] in a laboratory. He discovered this by chance when he was shooting neutrons at a [[uranium]] atom, hoping to create a new isotope.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.chemheritage.org/classroom/chemach/atomic/hahn-meitner.html|title=Otto Hahn, Liese Meitner and Fritz Strassman}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he noticed that instead of a new isotope the uranium simply changed into a [[barium]] atom. This was the world's first recorded nuclear fission reaction. This discovery eventually led to the creation of the [[atomic bomb]]. 

Further into the 20th century physicists went deeper into the mysteries of the atom. Using [[particle accelerator]]s they discovered that protons and neutrons were actually made of other particles, called [[quarks]].

The most accurate model so far comes from the [[Schrödinger equation]]. Schrödinger realized that the electrons exist in a cloud around the nucleus, called the [[electron cloud]]. In the electron cloud, it is impossible to know exactly where electrons are. The Schrödinger equation is used to find out where an electron is likely to be. This area is called the electron's [[atomic orbital|orbital]].

== Structure and parts ==
=== Parts ===

The complex atom is made up of three main particles; the [[proton]], the [[neutron]] and the [[electron]]. The [[isotope]] of [[Hydrogen]] Hydrogen-1 has no neutrons, and a positive hydrogen [[ion]] has no electrons. These are the only known exceptions, all other atoms have at least one proton, neutron and electron each. 

Electrons are by far the smallest of the three, their mass and size is too small to be measured using current technology.&lt;ref name=park&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://sciencepark.etacude.com/particle/structure.php|title=Particle Physics - Structure of a Matter}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a negative [[Electric charge|charge]]. Protons and neutrons are of similar size to each other&lt;ref name=park /&gt; Protons are positively charged and neutrons have no charge. 
Most atoms have a neutral charge; because the number of protons (positive) and electrons (negative) are the same, the charges balance out to zero. However in [[ion]]s (different number of electrons) this is not always the case and they can have a positive or a negative charge. Protons and Neutrons are made out of [[quark]]s, of two types; up quarks and down quarks. A proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark and a neutron is made of two down quarks and one up quark.

=== Nucleus ===
The nucleus is in the middle of an atom. It is made up of protons and neutrons. Usually in nature, two things with the same charge repel or shoot away from each other. So for a long time it was a mystery to scientists how the positively charged protons in the nucleus stayed together. They solved this by finding a particle called a [[Gluon]]. Its name comes from the word ''[[glue]]'' as Gluons act like atomic glue, sticking the protons together using the ''strong nuclear force''.  It is this force which also holds the quarks together that make up the protons and neutrons.

[[File:Nuclear fusion forces diagram.svg|thumb|left|250px|A diagram showing the main difficulty in [[nuclear fusion]], the fact that protons, which have positive charges, repel each other when forced together.]]

The number of neutrons in relation to protons defines whether the nucleus is stable or goes through [[radioactive decay]]. When there are too many neutrons or protons, the atom tries to make the numbers the same by getting rid of the extra particles. It does this by emitting radiation in the form of [[alpha particle|alpha]], [[beta particle|beta]] or [[gamma ray|gamma]] decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/quantskills/methods/quantlit/RadDecay.html|title=How does radioactive decay work?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclei can change through other means too. [[Nuclear fission]] is when the Nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei, releasing a lot of stored [[energy]]. This release energy is what makes nuclear fission useful for making [[bomb]]s and [[electricity]], in the form of [[nuclear power]]. 
The other way nuclei can change is through [[nuclear fusion]], when two nuclei join together, or fuse, to make a heavier nucleus. This process requires extreme amounts of energy in order to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between the protons, as they have the same charge. Such high energies are most common in [[star]]s like our [[Sun]], which fuses hydrogen for fuel.

=== Electrons ===
{{main|Electron}}

Electrons  orbit or go around the nucleus. They are called the atom's ''electron cloud''. They are attracted towards the nucleus because of the [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic force]]. Electrons have a negative charge and the nucleus always has a positive charge, so they attract each other. 
Around the nucleus some electrons are further out than others. These are called ''electron shells''. In most atoms the first shell has two electrons, and all after that have eight. Exceptions are rare, but they do happen and are difficult to predict.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.chemtutor.com/struct.htm#str|title=Chemtutor on atomic structure}}&lt;/ref&gt; The further away the electron is from the nucleus, the weaker the pull of the nucleus on it. This is why bigger atoms, with more electrons, react more easily with other atoms.
The electromagnetism of the nucleus is not enough to hold onto their electrons and they lose them to the strong attraction of smaller atoms. &lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.sciencebyjones.com/chemical_reactivity.htm|title=Chemical reactivity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radioactive decay ==
{{main|Radioactive decay}}

Some elements, and many isotopes, have what is called an ''unstable nucleus''. This means the nucleus is either too big to hold itself together&lt;ref name=Splung&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.splung.com/content/sid/5/page/radioactivity|title=Radioactivity}}&lt;/ref&gt; or has too many protons, electrons or neutrons. When this happens the nucleus has to get rid of the excess mass or particles. It does this through [[radiation]]. An atom that does this can be called ''radioactive''. Unstable atoms continue to be radioactive until they lose enough mass/particles that they become stable. All atoms above atomic number 82 (82 protons) are radioactive.&lt;ref name=Splung /&gt;

There are three main types of radioactive decay; [[alpha decay|alpha]], [[beta decay|beta]] and [[gamma ray|gamma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.s-cool.co.uk/gcse/physics/radioactivity/types-of-radiation.html|title=S-Cool: Types of radiation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Alpha decay]] is when the atom shoots out a particle having two protons and two neutrons. This is essentially a [[helium]] nucleus. The result is an element with atomic number two less than before. So for example if a [[beryllium]] atom (atomic number 4) went through alpha decay it would become helium (atomic number 2). Alpha decay happens when an atom is too big and needs to get rid of some mass.

* [[Beta decay]] is when a neutron turns into a proton or a proton turns into a neutron. In the first case the atom shoots out an electron, in the second case it is a [[positron]] (like an electron but with a positive charge). The end result is an element with one higher or one lower atomic number than before. Beta decay happens when an atom has either too many protons, or too many neutrons.

* [[Gamma ray|Gamma decay]] is when an atom shoots out a [[gamma ray]], or wave.  It happens when there is a change in the [[energy]] of the nucleus. This is usually after a nucleus has already gone through alpha or beta decay. There is no change in the mass, or atomic number or the atom, only in the stored energy inside the nucleus.

Every radioactive element or isotope has something called a ''half life''. This is how long it takes half of any sample of atoms of that type to decay until they become a different stable isotope or element.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/isotopes/radioactive_decay3.html|title=What is half-life?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large atoms, or isotopes with a big difference between the number of protons and neutrons will therefore have a long half life.

'''Astronomy''' is the study of the [[universe]] and everything in it. This includes [[star]]s, [[planet]]s and [[galaxies]] as well as other things. The word astronomy comes from the Greek words ''astron'' which means [[star]] and ''nomos'' which means [[law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=astronomy|title=Astronomy - and etymology|accessdate=2008-11-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person who studies astronomy is called an '''astronomer'''.

Astronomy is one of the oldest [[science]]s. Ancient people used the positions of the stars to navigate, and to find when was the best time to plant [[crops]]. Astronomy is very similar to [[astrophysics]]. Since the 20th century there have been two main types of astronomy, ''observational'' and ''theoretical'' astronomy. Observational astronomy uses [[telescope]]s and [[camera]]s to ''[[wikt:observe|observe]]'' or look at stars, galaxies and other astronomical objects. Theoretical astronomy uses [[maths]] and [[computer model]]s to predict what should happen. The two often work together, the theoretical predicts what should happen and the observational shows whether the prediction works. 

Astronomy is not the same as ''[[astrology]]'', the belief that the patterns the stars and the planets may affect [[human]] lives. 

== History of astronomy ==
{{main|History of astronomy}}
=== Ancient ===
Early astronomers used only their eyes to look at the stars. They used [[map]]s of the [[constellation]]s and stars for religious reasons and also to work out the time of year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=17322&amp;pageno=5|title=An online book - Gutenberg history of Astronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early civilisations such as the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] people and the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians built simple [[observatory|observatories]] and drew maps of the stars positions. They also began to think about the place of [[Earth]] in the [[universe]]. For a long time people thought [[Earth]] was the center of the universe, and that the planets, the stars and the sun went around it. This is known as the ''geocentric'' model of [[the Universe]].

[[Ancient Greeks]] tried to explain the motions of the sun and stars by taking measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| last = Krafft| first = Fritz| year = 2009| title = Astronomy| editor-last = Cancik| editor-first = Hubert| editor2-last = Schneider| editor2-first = Helmuth| encyclopedia = [[Brill's New Pauly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A mathematician named [[Eratosthenes]] was the first who measured the size of the Earth and proved that the Earth is a [[sphere]]. A theory by another mathematician named [[Aristarchus]] was, that the sun is in the center and the Earth is moving around it. This is known as the ''Heliocentric'' model. Only a small group of people thought it was right. The rest continued to believe in the ''geocentric'' model.

Most of the names of constellations and stars that we have, come from Greeks of that time.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, H., ''Early Astronomy.'' Springer, 1994. p.2&lt;/ref&gt; 

Arabic astronomers made many advancements during the [[Middle Ages]] including improved star maps and ways to estimate the size of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/1612/medieval.html|title=A brief history of Astronomy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Renaissance to modern era ===
[[File:Galileo moon phases.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawings of [[the Moon]] by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]. His drawings were more detailed than anyone before him because he used a telescope to look at the Moon.]]
During the [[renaissance]] a priest named [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] thought, from looking at the way the planets moved, that the Earth was not the center of everything. Based on previous works, he said that the Earth was a [[planet]] and all the planets moved around the sun, bringing the ''heliocentric'' model back to the light. A physicist called [[Galileo Galilei]] built his own [[telescope]], and used it to look more closely at the stars and planets for the first time. He agreed with Copernicus.  Their ideas were also improved by [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton]] who came up with the [[wikt:theory|theory]] of [[gravity]]. At this time the [[Catholic Church]] decided that Galileo was wrong. [[The Pope]] gave the order to lock Galileo up in his house and they did not let him write any more [[book]]s until he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://galileo.rice.edu/bio/narrative_7.html|title=Galileo Project - Galileo and the inquisition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Galileo, people made better telescopes and used them to see farther objects such as the planets [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]. They also saw how stars were similar to our Sun, but in a range of colours and sizes. They also saw thousands of other faraway objects such as [[Galaxy|galaxies]] and [[nebula]]e.

=== Modern era ===  
The 20th century saw important changes in astronomy.

In 1931, Karl Jansky discovered radio emission from outside the Earth when trying to isolate a source of noise in radio communications, marking the birth of radio astronomy and the first attempts at using another part of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]] to observe the sky. Those parts of the electromagnetic spectrum that the atmosphere did not block were now opened up to astronomy, allowing more discoveries to be made.

The opening of this new window on the [[Universe]] saw the discovery of entirely new things, for example [[pulsar]]s, which sent regular pulses of radio waves out into space. The waves were first thought to be alien in origin because the pulses were so regular that it implied an artificial source.

The period after [[World War 2]] saw more [[observatory|observatories]] where large and accurate telescopes are built and operated at good observing sites, normally by governments.  For example, [[Bernard Lovell]] began radio astronomy at Jodrell Bank using leftover military [[radar]] equipment.  By 1957, the site had the largest steerable radio telescope in the world. Similarly, the end of the 1960s saw the start of the building of dedicated observatories at [[Mauna Kea]] in [[Hawaii]], a good site for visible and infra-red telescopes thanks to its high altitude and clear skies.  Mauna Kea would eventually come to host very large and very accurate telescopes like the Keck Observatory with its 10-meter mirror.  

The next great revolution in astronomy was thanks to the birth of rocketry.  This allowed telescopes to be placed in space on [[satellite (artificial)|satellites]].

Satellite-based telescopes opened up the Universe to human eyes. Turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere blurs images taken by ground-based telescopes, an effect known as seeing.  It is this effect that makes stars &quot;twinkle&quot; in the sky.  As a result, the pictures taken by satellite telescopes in visible light (for example, by the Hubble Space Telescope) are much clearer than Earth-based telescopes, even though Earth-based telescopes are very large.

[[Space observatory|Space telescopes]] gave access, for the first time in history, to the entire [[electromagnetic spectrum]] including rays that had been blocked by the atmosphere.  The [[X-ray]]s, [[gamma ray]]s, [[ultraviolet]] light and parts of the [[infra-red]] spectrum were all opened to astronomy as observing telescopes were launched.  As with other parts of the spectrum, new discoveries were made.

From 1970s satellites were launched to be replaced with more accurate and better satellites, causing the sky to be mapped in nearly all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum.

== Discoveries ==
Discoveries broadly come in two types:  bodies and phenomena.  Bodies are things in the Universe, whether it is a planet like our Earth or a galaxy like our Milky Way.  Phenomena are events and happenings in the Universe.  

=== Bodies ===
For convenience, this section has been divided by where these astronomical bodies may be found: those found around stars are solar bodies, those inside galaxies are galactic bodies and everything else larger are cosmic bodies.

==== Solar ====
* [[Planet]]s
* [[Asteroid]]s
* [[Comet]]s

==== Galactic ====
*[[Star]]s

Diffuse Objects:
* [[Nebula]]s
* Clusters

Compact Stars:
* [[White dwarf|White dwarves]]
* [[Neutron star]]s
* [[Black hole]]s

==== Cosmic ====
* [[Galaxy|Galaxies]]
* Clusters
* Superclusters.

=== Phenomena ===
Burst events are those where there is a sudden change in the heavens that disappears quickly.  These are called bursts because they are normally associated with large explosions producing a &quot;burst&quot; of energy.  They include: 
* [[Supernova]]s
* [[Nova]]s

Periodic events are those that happen regularly in a repetitive way.  The name periodic comes from period, which is the length of time required for a [[Wave (physics)|wave]] to complete one cycle.  Periodic phenomena include: 
* [[Pulsar]]s
* [[Variable star]]s

Noise phenomena tend to relate to things that happened a long time ago.  The signal from these events bounce around the Universe until it seems to come from everywhere and varies little in intensity.  In this way, it resembles &quot;noise&quot;, the background signal that pervades every instrument used for astronomy.  The most common example of noise is static seen on analogue televisions.  The principal astronomical example is: [[Cosmic background radiation]].

== Methods ==
=== Instruments ===
* [[Telescopes]] are the main tool of observing. They take all the light in a big area and put in into a small area. This is like making your eyes very big and powerful. Astronomers use telescopes to look at things that are far away and dim. Telescopes make objects look bigger, closer, brighter. 
* [[Spectrometer]]s study the different [[wavelength]]s of light. This shows what something is made of. 
* Many telescopes are in satellites. They are [[space observatory|space observatories]]. 

=== Techniques ===
There are way  astronomers can get better pictures of the heavens.  Light from a distant source reaches a [[sensor]] and gets measured, normally by a human eye or a camera.  For very dim sources, there may not be enough light particles coming from the source for it to be seen.  One technique that astronomers have for making it visible is using ''integration'', (which is like longer exposures in [[photography]]).

==== Integration ====
Astronomical sources do not move much: only the rotation and movement of the Earth causes them to move across the heavens. As light particles reach the camera over time, they hit the same place making it brighter and more visible then the background, until it can be seen.  

Telescopes at most observatories (and satellite instruments) can normally track a source as it moves across the heavens, making the star appear still to the telescope and allowing longer exposures.  Also, images can be taken on different nights so exposures span hours, days or even months. In the digital era, digitised pictures of the sky can be added together by [[computer]], which overlays the images after correcting for movement.

==== Aperture synthesis ====
With [[radio telescope]]s smaller telescopes can be combined together to create a big one, which works like one as big as the distance between the two smaller telescopes.

==== Adaptive optics ====
[[Adaptive optics]] means changing the shape of the mirror or lens while looking at something, to see it better.

=== Data analysis ===
Data analysis is the process of getting more information out of an astronomical observation than by simply looking at it. The observation is first stored as data.  This data will then have various techniques used to [[analysis\analyse]] it.

==== Fourier analysis ====
[[Fourier analysis]] in mathematics can show if an observation (over a length of time) is changing periodically (changes like a wave).  If so, it can extract the frequencies and the type of wave pattern, and find many things including new planets.

== Fields ==
A good example of a fields comes from [[pulsar]]s which pulse regularly in [[radio waves]].  These turned out to be similar to some (but not all) of a type of bright source in X-rays called a Low-mass X-ray binary.  It turned out that all pulsars and some LMXBs are neutron stars and that the differences were due to the environment in which the neutron star was found. Those LMXBs that were not neutron stars turned out to be black holes.

This section attempts to provide an overview of the important fields of astronomy, their period of importance and the terms used to describe them. It should be noted that astronomy in the Modern Era has been divided mainly by electromagnetic spectrum, although there is some evidence this is changing.

=== Fields by body ===
==== Solar astronomy ====
{{main|Sun}}

Solar astronomy is the study of the [[Sun]]. The Sun is the closest star to Earth at around 92 million (92,000,000) miles away.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.gi.alaska.edu/ScienceForum/ASF1/142.html|title=Sun/Earth distance, article #144|accessdate=2009-3-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the easiest to observe in detail. Observing the Sun can help us understand how other stars work and are formed. Changes in the Sun can affect the weather and climate on Earth. A stream of charged [[particle]]s called the [[Solar wind]] is constantly sent off from the Sun. The Solar Wind hitting the Earth's [[magnetic field]] causes the [[Aurora|northern lights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/Education/Isun.html|title=The Solar Wind and the Van Allen radiation belts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying the Sun helped people understand how [[nuclear fusion]] works.

==== Planetary astronomy ====
Planetary Astronomy is the study of [[planet]]s, [[Satellite (natural)|moons]], [[dwarf planet]]s, [[comet]]s and [[asteroid]]s as well as other small objects that orbit stars. The planets of our own [[Solar System]] have been studied in depth by many visiting [[spacecraft]] such as [[Cassini-Huygens]] ([[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]) and the [[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2|2]].

==== Galactic astronomy ====
Galactic Astronomy is the study of distant [[galaxy|galaxies]].  Studying distant galaxies is the best way of learning about our own galaxy, as the gases and stars in our own galaxy make it difficult to observe.  Galactic Astronomers attempt to understand the structure of galaxies and how they are formed through the use of different types of telescopes and computer simulations.

=== Fields by electromagnetic spectrum ===
==== Radio astronomy ====
*[[Radio telescope]]

==== Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) ====
Hydrodynamics is used in astronomy for [[mathematical model|mathematically modelling]] how gases behave. Strong [[magnetic field]]s found around many bodies can drastically change how these gases behave, affecting things from star formation to the flows of gases around compact stars. This makes MHD an important and useful tool in astronomy.

=== Other fields ===
==== Gravitational wave astronomy ====
Gravitational wave astronomy is the study of the [[Universe]] in the gravitational wave spectrum.  So far, all astronomy that has been done has used the [[electromagnetic spectrum]].  Gravitational Waves are ripples in [[spacetime]] emitted by very dense objects changing shape, which include [[White dwarf|white dwarves]], [[neutron star]]s and [[black hole]]s.  Because no one has been able to detect gravitational waves directly, the impact of Gravitational Wave Astronomy has been very limited.

'''Architecture''' is the [[science]] of the [[design]] of [[structure]]s or [[building]]s such as houses, places of worship, office buildings.  Architecture is also the [[profession]] of an [[architect]]. A person must [[wikt:study|study]] at an [[institution]] of [[higher education]] to become an [[architect]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Architecture can be about small designs such as a [[garage]] or large designs such as a whole [[city]]. Architecture often overlaps with [[civil engineering]], and architects and civil engineers often work together.

__TOC__

== History ==
[[File:Saint Leonardo vault.PNG|thumb|left|Romanesque groin vault]]
In the past people built [[wikt:hut|hut]]s and wood [[house]]s to protect themselves from the weather. For safety, they were often close together. Great [[civilization]]s like the [[Ancient Egypt]]ians built large [[temples]] and structures, like the [[Great Pyramids of Giza]]. The [[Ancient Greek]]s and [[ Ancient Rome|Roman]]s made what we now call [[Classical Architecture]]. The Romans, working over 2000 years ago, copied the [[arch]] from the [[Etruscans]], who copied it from the [[Mesopotamia]]ns. The [[stone]] [[column]]s, which still hold up so many important buildings, like the [[Parthenon]] in [[Athens]], were simply copied from the first wooden posts.

[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|right|Pyramids in [[Giza]]]]
'''Classical Architecture''' was very formal; it always obeyed [[laws]]. It used [[symmetry]], which really means [[wikt:simple:balance|balance]], and it used [[proportion]] which means keeping shapes in certain ways. The [[Golden ratio|Golden Mean]] was a rule (or law) which said, (to put it very simply) if you are making a room, or any other thing, it will work best if you always make the long side 1.6 times longer than the short side. There are many laws in Classical Architecture, like how high the middle of an arched [[bridge]] needs to be (which depends on how wide the bridge needs to be). These laws were learned from thousands of [[year]]s of experience and they are as true today as they were 2000 years ago.

In some parts of the world, like [[India]], the architecture is famous for [[carving]] the stone on temples and palaces. Different architectural styles were made in [[China]], [[Japan]], Southeast Asia, [[Africa]], [[Mexico]], and Central and [[South America]].

Later, people in [[Western Europe]] in the [[Middle Ages]] made [[Romanesque architecture]], then [[Gothic architecture]].  Gothic buildings have tall, pointed [[window]]s and arches.  Many [[church]]es have Gothic architecture. [[Castle]]s were also built at this time. In [[Eastern Europe]], churches usually had [[dome]]s. People added their own ideas and [[decoration]] to the Classical Architecture of the past.  The [[Renaissance]] brought a return to classical ideas. 
[[File:NYC - Guggenheim Museum.jpg|thumb|left|There can be many different kinds of styles to architecture, such as the curved dome on the [[Guggenheim Museum]] in [[New York City]]]]
In the late 18th century with the [[Industrial Revolution]], people began to [[invent]] machines to make things quickly and cheaply. Many [[factory|factories]] and [[Mill (factory)|mills]] were built during, or after this revolution. Decades later, in the [[Victorian era]], architects like [[George Fowler Jones]] and [[Decimus Burton]] still followed the Gothic style to build new churches. Up to this point, buildings were limited in size and style by the strength of the wood and [[masonry]] used to construct them. Gothic cathedrals were among the largest buildings because the gothic arch when combined with buttresses allowed stone buildings to be built taller. For example, the cathedral in [[Ulm]], Germany is over 500 feet tall. However, building with stone has its limits, and building too tall could result in collapse, an example of which is the [[Beauvais Cathedral]], which was never completed. 
[[File:Sears Tower ss.jpg|thumb|New technology allows new kinds of buildings such as for the [[Willis Tower]] in [[Chicago]]]]

Towards the end of the 19th Century with a second Industrial Revolution, [[steel]] became much cheaper. Architects began to use inventions like metal girders and [[reinforced concrete]] to build. An example is the [[Eiffel Tower]] in [[Paris]]. Buildings can now be built taller than ever before. We call them [[skyscrapers]]. This new [[technology]] has made us free from traditional limitations, and because of the new possibilities presented by these materials, many traditional methods of construction and ideas about style were reevaluated, replaced, or abandoned. Cheap, strong glass soon brought transparent exterior walls, especially for office buildings. 

[[Modernism]] is the name for the architectural style which developed because of these new building technologies, and its beginnings can been seen as early as [[1890]]. Modernism can also refer to a specific group of architects and buildings from the early to late 20th century, and so may not be the proper term to use for many building built since then, which are sometimes called &quot;post-modern&quot;.

Many of the world's greatest structures were build by modern day architects such as [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], [[I. M. Pei]], [[Adrian Smith (architect)|Adrian Smith]], [[Edward Durell Stone]], [[Fazlur Khan]], and [[Bruce Graham]].

'''Anatomy''' is the [[research|study]] of the [[body|bodies]] of living beings.  This can be [[human|people]], [[animal]]s, or [[plant]]s. It is like taking the body apart, and looking at its parts ([[organ (anatomy)|organs]], [[muscle]]s and [[bone]]s). People who study ''anatomy'' then look where a certain organ (or bone, or muscle) should be, or where it normally is.

The history of anatomy dates back to 1600 BCE when [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]] began studying human anatomy. They discovered the functions of many organs like the liver, spleen, kidneys, heart etc. and were the first to discover the structure and functions of the lymphatic system.

[[Academic]] human anatomists are usually employed by universities, medical schools or teaching hospitals. They are often involved in teaching anatomy, and research into certain systems, organs, tissues or cells.

==Body Systems==

There are different systems, such as the cardiovascular system, also known as the [[circulatory system]] (the system that gets [[blood]] around the body), the muscular system (the system that contains [[muscle]]s), the [[nervous system]] (the system that controls the [[nerve]]s,and the brain) and the [[skeleton]] (the bones). 

Human anatomy, [[physiology]] and [[biochemistry]] are similar basic medical sciences.

An '''asteroid''' is a small object in the [[Solar System]] that travels around the [[Sun]]. It is like a [[planet]], but smaller. The name &quot;asteroid&quot; means &quot;like a star&quot; in the ancient [[Greek language]]. Asteroids may look like small stars in the sky, but they really do move around the [[Sun]], while stars only seem to move because the [[Earth]] spins. Like planets, asteroids do not make their own [[light]]. Because of this, some people think &quot;asteroids&quot; is not a good name, and think that the name &quot;planetoid&quot; (&quot;like a planet&quot;) would be a better name.

Giuseppe Piazzi found the first asteroid, in 1801. It was named [[Ceres]], and is the biggest object in the [[asteroid belt]]. Other asteroids in the asteroid belt, like [[3 Juno|Juno]], [[Pallas]], and [[Vesta]] were found later. Today, astronomers using computerized [[telescope]]s find thousands of asteroids every month, which range from 1 km (less than a mile) to 600 miles (1000 km) across. A few asteroids have [[asteroid moon]]s.

Asteroids are the leftover rock and other material from the formation of the [[Solar System]]. These rocks were too small to make a planet, and could not collide to form one. Most asteroids are made of [[mineral|rock]], but some are made of [[carbon]] or [[metal]]. Depending on what's on the surface, they are classified into various kinds in including Type M (metal), Type S (stone), and Type C (carbon).

Most asteroids in our [[Solar System]] are in the [[asteroid belt]] between [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] and [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]. Many are not in the main asteroid belt. The ones that come close to Earth are called [[Near-Earth asteroid]]s. Many scientists think asteroids striking the Earth killed off [[K/T extinction event|all the dinosaurs]] and caused some of the other [[extinction event]]s.

'''Afghanistān''' (officially called '''Islamic Republic of Afghanistan'''; {{lang-ps|د افغانستان اسلامي جمهوريت}}, {{lang-fa|جمهوری اسلامی افغانستان}}) is a [[country]] in [[South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://millenniumindicators.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm#asia |title=Composition of macro geographical (continental) regions, geographical sub-regions, and selected economic and other groupings |publisher=[[United Nations]] |date=26 April 2011 |accessdate=13 July 2011| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110713041240/http://millenniumindicators.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm| archivedate=13 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; It has borders with [[Pakistan]] in the south and east, [[Iran]] in the west, [[Turkmenistan]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Tajikistan]] in the north, and [[China]] in the far northeast.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/af.html |title=Afghanistan |work=CIA - The World Factbook |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early times people passed through it with animals and other goods as it connected China and India with Central Asia and the Middle East. More recently, Afghanistan has been damaged by many years of war and no jobs.

The country is around 251,826 square [[miles]] (652,230 square kilometers) in size or area. There are 30 million people in Afghanistan. There are about 3 million Afghan [[refugees]] who are in Pakistan and Iran for some time. [[Kabul]], the big city, had about 3,691,400 people living in it in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;cso.gov.af&quot;&gt;http://cso.gov.af/Content/files/2-2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Land and climate ==
[[File:Black Hawk flying over a valley in Bamyan.jpg|left|thumb|Snow-capped Koh-i-Baba mountains in [[Bamyan Province]] of Afghanistan.]]
Afghanistan has many [[mountains]]. The mountains are called [[Hindu Kush Range]] and [[Himalayas]]. The big mountain in Afghanistan is [[Noshaq|Mount Nowshak]]. There are [[plains]] (which have soil that is good for growing plants) and [[foothills]]. Part is also dry and called the [[Registan Desert]].

Afghanistan has snow and [[glaciers]] in the mountains. [[Amu Darya]] is the big water stream, or river.

Afghanistan is dry and cold in winter and hot in summer. No water sometimes causes problems for [[farmers]]. [[Sandstorms]] happen a lot in the [[desert]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Afghanistan.&quot; Britannica Student Library. Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has a lot of a [[valuable]] [[stone]] called [[lapis lazuli]], which was used to decorate the [[tomb]] of the [[Egypt]]ian king [[Tutankhamun]].&lt;ref name=ngk&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/kids/places/find/afghanistan/ |title=Afghanistan Facts and Pictures |work=National Geographic Kids |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plants and Animals ==
[[File:Uncia uncia 2.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Endangered [[snow leopard]]s live in the cold [[Hindu Kush]], but they have thick [[fur]] to stay warm. Hunters sell the soft leopard skins in the markets in the capital [[Kabul]].]]
[[South]]ern Afghanistan has not many plants because it is dry. There are more plants where there is more water. Mountains have [[forests]] of [[pine]] and [[fir]]. [[cedar]], [[oak]], [[walnut]], [[alder]], and [[ash tree]]s.

Afghanistan's animals are in the mountains. There are [[wolves]], [[foxes]], [[jackals]], [[bears]], and wild [[goat]]s, [[gazelle]]s, wild dogs, [[camel]]s, and [[wild cat]]s such as the [[snow leopard]] in the country. The birds are [[falcon]]s, [[eagles]] and [[vulture]]s. The [[Rhesus Macaque]] and the red flying [[squirrel]] are also in Afghanistan.

Many years of [[war]], [[hunting]], and years of no water have killed animals in Afghanistan. [[Tigers]] used to be in Afghanistan, but they are [[extinct]], which means that there are no more tigers there. Bears and wolves are almost gone.&lt;ref name=ngk/&gt;

== People and culture ==
[[File:2011 Afghan Youth Voices Festival.jpg|thumb|left|The 2011 Afghan Youth Voices Festival at the Gardens of Babur in [[Kabul]].]]
Many different cultures have moved through or invaded the land of Afghanistan. Today the people of Afghanistan, known as ''Afghans'', have many traits passed down from these groups. The largest ethnic group is the [[Pashtuns]] (or ethnic Afghans), who make up about half the Afghan people.&lt;ref&gt;See:

Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Pashtuns are also related to the Iranian peoples, and some Pashtuns and Tajiks marry each other but at the same time they are rivals. The country's other ethnic groups include the [[Hazara]], [[Uzbek]], [[Aimak]], [[Turkmen]], [[Nuristani people|Nuristani]], [[Baloch people|Baloch]], Pashai and a few others.

Most people who live in cities can speak more than one language. Dari is the native or mother language of the Tajik, Hazara, and some other groups. Both Pashto and Dari belong to the [[Indo-European languages]], but they are usually written with the [[Arabic alphabet]]. [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] are widely spoken in the north and [[Nuristani language|Nuristani]] and [[Pashai language|Pashai]] are spoken in the east.&lt;ref name=AO/&gt; Almost all Afghans follow the religion of [[Islam]].

Afghanistan is a largely [[rural]] country, which means that there are only few major cities and much spaced-apart land. Only about one fifth of the population lives in cities. [[Kabul]], the capital, is the largest city. It is along the [[Kabul River]] south of the [[Hindu Kush]] range. Other cities in Afghanistan include [[Kandahar]], [[Herat]], [[Mazar-e Sharif]], and [[Jalalabad]]. The rural population is made up of farmers and nomads (people who move or travel from place to place). The farmers live mainly in small villages along the rivers. The nomads live in tents while moving from place to place with their animals and belongings. Some Afghan people live in the high central mountains or the deserts in the south and southwest. Millions of people escaped from Afghanistan in order to not get involved in the wars that happened in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Most of them lived in neighboring Pakistan and Iran.

== History ==
Afghanistan is in the [[Trail|path]] of important trade routes that connect southern and eastern [[Asia]] to [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]]. Because of this, many empire builders have decided to rule over the area.

=== Prehistory ===
[[File:Raffael 071.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Zoroaster]], the founder of [[Zoroastrianism]], lived in [[Bactria]], an ancient land in the north of today's Afghanistan.]]
[[Archaeology|Archaeologists]] digging a cave in what is now northeastern Afghanistan (in [[Badakhshan Province|Badakhshan]]), discovered that people lived in the country as early as 100,000 years ago. They found the skull of a [[Neanderthal]], or early human, as well as tools from about 30,000 years ago. In other parts of Afghanistan, archaeologists uncovered [[pottery]] and tools that are 4,000 to 11,000 years old—evidence that Afghans were among the first people in the world to grow crops and raise animals.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;&quot;Afghanistan.&quot; Britannica Elementary Library.

Farmers and herders settled in the plains surrounding the [[Hindu Kush]] as early as 7000 B.C. These people may have grown rich off the [[lapis lazuli]] they found along riverbeds, which they traded to early city sites to the west, across the [[Iranian plateau]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. As farms and villages grew and thrived in Afghanistan, these ancient people eventually invented [[irrigation]] (digging ditches for water so it flows to crops) that allowed them to grow crops on the northern Afghanistan desert plains. This [[civilization]] is today called BMAC ([[Bactria–Margiana Archaeological Complex]]), or the &quot;Oxus civilization&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Hiebert, F., Cambon, P., 2008, AFGHANISTAN Hidden Treasures from the National Museum, Kabul, page 58, Washington, National Geographic, ISBN 978-1-4262-0295-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oxus civilization expanded as far east as western edge of the [[Indus Valley]] during the period between 2200 and 1800 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Hiebert, F., Cambon, P., 2008, AFGHANISTAN Hidden Treasures from the National Museum, Kabul, page 73, Washington, National Geographic, ISBN 978-1-4262-0295-7&lt;/ref&gt; These people, who were the ancestors of the Indo-Aryans, used the term &quot;[[Aryan]]&quot; to identify their ethnicity, culture, and religion. Scholars know this when they read the ancient texts of these people; the [[Avesta (religious scripture)|Avesta]] of Iranian people and the [[Vedas]] of Indo-Aryans.&lt;ref&gt;[R.

According to the Avesta, Aryans settled in sixteen districts in the area, beginning with ''Airiana vaejo'' (land of Aryans), and following with Bāxδī = Bactria or [[Balkh]]; Nisāya = a district between Margiana and Bactria; Harōiva = Areia or [[Herat|Herāt]]; Vaēkərəta = Gandhāra; Urvā = [[Ghazni Province|Ghazni]] region; Haraxᵛaitī = Arachosia or [[Kandahar]]; Haētumant = [[Helmand Province|Helmand]] region; Raγa = a district north of Haraxᵛaitī and Haētumant; Čaxra = Čarx between Ghazni and Kabul, in the valley of Logar.&lt;ref&gt;[Encyclopedia Iranica, AVESTAN GEOGRAPHY.

Even though there are later traditions which place him in Azerbaijan and Media, it is more reasonable to locate Zoroaster somewhere in today's Afghanistan along with the rest of the Avesta. Further, the two Avestan dialects belong linguistically to eastern [ancient] Iran [today's Afghanistan]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ancient history ===
[[File:Ancient Khorasan highlighted.jpg|thumb|Names of territories during the [[Caliphate]] in 750 CE. [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] was part of Persia (in [[yellow]]ish).]]
By the middle of the sixth century BC, the [[Achaemenids]] took over control of the land, which was previously held by the [[Medes]], and made it part of the [[Persian empire]]. [[Alexander the great]] defeated and conquered the Persian Empire in 330 BC. He founded some cities in the area and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] culture and language continued to influence the people for a long period, right up to the [[Islamic conquest]] in the 7th century A.D. After Alexander, [[Greco-Bactrians]], [[Scythians]], [[Kushans]], [[Parthians]] and [[Sassanians]] ruled the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/851961/ancient-Iran |title=ancient Iran |work=Britannica Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kushans spread [[Buddhism]] from [[India]] in the 1st century B.C., and Buddhism remained an important religion in the area until the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;[Encyclopedia Iranica, BUDDHISM i. In Pre-Islamic Times. Retrieved on 12 September 2010 http://iranica.com/articles/buddhism-i]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Buddhas of Bamiyan]] were the remainder of Buddhism in Afghanistan. Those giant statues were destroyed by the very religious [[Taliban]] in 2001, despite international protests in defence of the priceless art. The Taliban believed that those ancient statues were [[Islam|un-Islamic]] and a curse on Afghanistan.

=== Medieval history ===

[[Arabs]] introduced [[Islam]] in the 7th century and slowly began spreading the new religion. In the 9th and 10th centuries, many local Islamic dynasties rose to power inside Afghanistan. One of the earliest was the [[Tahirids]], whose kingdom included [[Balkh]] and [[Herat]]; they established independence from the [[Abbasids]] in 820. The Ṭahirids were succeeded in about 867 by the [[Saffarids]] of [[Zaranj]] in western Afghanistan. Local princes in the north soon became [[wikt:feudatory|feudatories]] of the powerful [[Samanids]], who ruled from [[Bukhara]]. From 872 to 999, north of the Hindu Kush in Afghanistan enjoyed a golden age under Samanid rule.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Afghanistan.&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopaedia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 10th century, the local [[Ghaznavid Empire|Ghaznavids]] turned [[Ghazni]] into their capital and firmly established Islam throughout all areas of Afghanistan, except the Kafiristan region in the northeast. [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], a great Ghaznavid [[sultan]], conquered the [[Multan]] and [[Punjab region]], and carried raids into the heart of [[India]]. Mohammed bin Abdul Jabbar Utbi (Al-Utbi), a historian from the 10th century, wrote that thousands of &quot;Afghans&quot; were in the Ghaznavid army.&lt;ref name=&quot;Houtsma&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=E.J.

Arab geographers even spoke of its extending to the boundaries of [[Hindustan|India]].''|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |date=|accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

All the major cities of modern Afghanistan were centers of science and culture in the past. The New Persian [[literature]] arose and flourished in the area. The early Persian poets such as [[Rudaki]] were from what is now Afghanistan. Moreover, [[Ferdowsi]], the author of [[Shahnameh]], the national [[Epic poetry|epic]] of Iran, and [[Rumi]], the famous [[Sufi]] poet, were also from modern-day Afghanistan. It has produced scientists such as [[Avicenna]], [[Al-Farabi]], [[Al-Biruni]], [[Omar Khayyám]], [[Al-Khwarizmi]], and many others who are widely known for their important contributions in different domains such as [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[medicine]], [[physics]], [[geography]], and [[geology]]. It remained the cultural capital of Persia until the devastating [[Mongol]] invasion in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lorentz, J. Historical Dictionary of Iran. 1995 ISBN 0-8108-2994-0 AFGHANISTAN&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Timur]], the Turkic conqueror, took over in the end of the 14th century and began to rebuild cities in this region. Timur's successors, the [[Timurids]] (1405–1507), were great patrons of learning and the arts who enriched their capital city of Herat with fine buildings. Under their rule Afghanistan enjoyed peace and prosperity.

Between south of the Hindu Kush and the Indus River (today's Pakistan) was the native land of the Afghan tribes. They called this land &quot;Afghanistan&quot; (meaning &quot;land of the Afghans&quot;). The Afghans ruled the rich northern Indian subcontinent with their capital at [[Delhi]]. From the 16th to the early 18th century, Afghanistan was disputed between the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]] of [[Isfahan]] and the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] of [[Agra]] who had replaced the [[Lodi dynasty|Lodi]] and [[Sur Empire|Suri]] Afghan rulers in India. The Safavids and Mughals occasionally oppressed the native Afghans but at the same time the Afghans used each empire to punish the other. In 1709, the [[Hotaki dynasty|Hotaki]] Afghans rose to power and completely defeated the Persian Empire. Then they marched towards the Mughals of India and nominally defeated them with the help of the Afsharid forces under Nader Shah Afshar. 

In 1747, after Nader Shah of Persia was killed, a great leader named [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] united all the different Muslim tribes and established the Afghan Empire ([[Durrani Empire]]). He is considered the founding father of the modern state of Afghanistan&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; while [[Mirwais Hotak]] is the grandfather of the nation.

===Recent history===
During the 1800s, Afghanistan became a buffer zone between two powerful empires, [[British India]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. As British India advanced into Afghanistan, Russia felt threatened and expanded southward across Central Asia. To stop the Russian advance, British tried to make Afghanistan part of its empire but the Afghans fought wars with British-led Indians from 1839 to 1842 and from 1878 to 1880. After the third war in 1919, Afghanistan under [[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah]] gained respect and recognition as a completely independent state.

The Kingdom of Afghanistan was a [[constitutional monarchy]] established in 1926. It was the successor state to the [[Emirate]] of [[Afghanistan]]. On 27 September 1934, during the reign of Zahir Shah, the Kingdom of Afghanistan joined the [[League of Nations]].  During [[World War II]], Afghanistan remained neutral. It pursued a [[Diplomacy|diplomatic policy]] of non-alignment.

The creation of Pakistan in 1947 as its eastern neighbor created problems. In 1973, political crises led to the overthrow of the king. The country's new leader ended the monarchy and made Afghanistan a [[republic]]. In 1978, a [[Communist]] political party supported by the [[Soviet Union]] seized control of Afghanistan's government. This move sparked rebellions throughout the country. The government asked the Soviet Union for military assistance. The Soviets took advantage of the situation and [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|invaded Afghanistan in December 1979]].

Most people in Afghanistan opposed the sudden Soviet presence in their country. For nearly a decade, anti-Communist Islamic forces known as ''Mujahideen'' were trained inside neighboring Pakistan to fight the Soviets and the Afghan government. The [[United States]] and other anti-Soviet countries supported the Mujahideen. In the long war, over one million Afghan civilians were killed. The Soviet Army also lost more than 15,000 soldiers in that war. Millions of Afghans left their country to stay safe in neighboring Pakistan and Iran. In 1989 the Soviet Army withdrew the last of its troops.
[[File:2011 Afghan Independence Day-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Former [[President of Afghanistan|Afghan President]] [[Hamid Karzai]] at the 2011 Afghan Independence Day in [[Kabul]].]]
After the Soviets left, different Afghan warlords began fighting for control of the country. The warlords received support from other countries, including neighboring Pakistan and Iran. A very conservative [[Islamic]] group known as the [[Taliban]] emerged in an attempt to end the civil war. By the late 1990s the Taliban had gained control over 95% of Afghanistan. A group known as the Northern Alliance, based in northern Afghanistan near the border with Tajikistan, continued to fight against the Taliban.
[[File:Afghan soldiers.jpg|left|thumb|[[NATO]]-trained [[Afghan National Army]] (ANA).]]
[[File:Military terminal at Kabul International Airport.jpg|thumb|upright|NATO's military terminal at [[Kabul International Airport]]]]
The Taliban ruled Afghanistan according to their strict version of Islamic law. People whom the Taliban believed violated these laws were given cruel punishments. In addition, the Taliban completely restricted the rights of women. Because of such policies, most countries refused to recognize the Taliban government. Only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirate (UAE) accepted them as the official government.

The Taliban also angered other countries by allowing suspected terrorists to live freely in Afghanistan. Among them were [[Osama bin Laden]] and members of [[al-Qaeda]] terrorist network. In September 2001, the United States blamed bin Laden for the [[September 11 attacks|terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York City and the Pentagon outside Washington, D.C.]] The Taliban refused to hand him over to the United States. In response, the United States and its allies launched a bombing campaign against al-Qaeda in October 2001. Within months the Taliban abandoned Kabul and a new government led by [[Hamid Karzai]] came to power, but fighting between the Taliban and US-led armies continued. The Taliban are coming into Afghanistan from neighboring Pakistan, Afghans accuse Pakistan's military for being behind the Taliban militants but Pakistan has been rejecting this and stating that a stable Afghanistan is in Pakistan's own interest.

In December 2004, Hamid Karzai became the first [[democracy|democratically]] elected president of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; [[NATO]] began rebuilding Afghanistan, including its military and government institutions. Many schools and colleges were built in the last ten years. Freedom for women improved, they can study, work, drive and run for offices. Many Afghan women work as politicians, some are ministers while at least one is a mayor. Others have opened businesses, or joined the military or police. Afghanistan's over-all economy has also improved dramatically and NATO states had agreed in 2012 to help the country for at least another 10 years after 2014. In the meantime, Afghanistan improved diplomatic ties with many countries in the world and continues to establish new ties with other states.

'''Argentina''' (officially called '''Argentine Republic''')  is a country in [[South America]]. Argentina is the second-largest [[country]] in [[South America]] and the eighth-largest country in the world. 

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the language most people speak and the official language, but many other languages are spoken. Some of these are [[German language|German]], [[Guaraní language|Guarani]], [[Mapudungun]] and [[Quechua]] and even [[Welsh language|Welsh]] in [[Patagonia]].

The [[capital (city)|capital city]] of the Argentina is [[Buenos Aires]], one of the largest cities in the world, in eastern Argentina. In order by number of people, the largest [[city|cities]] in Argentina are [[Buenos Aires]], [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], [[Rosario]], [[Mendoza]], [[La Plata]], [[Tucumán]], [[Mar del Plata]], [[Salta]], [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]], and [[Bahía Blanca]]. 

Argentina is between the [[Andes]] [[mountain range]] in the west and the southern [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the east and south. It is bordered by [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]] in the north, [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]] in the northeast, and [[Chile]] in the west and south. It also claims the [[Falkland Islands]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Islas Malvinas'') and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]].

== History ==
The name '''Argentina''' comes from the [[Latin]] ''argentum'' ([[silver]]) as the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]s believed the area had [[silver]]. In the Americas, Canada, US, Brazil and Argentina are the largest countries (in that order).

The oldest signs of people in Argentina are in the [[Patagonia]] (Piedra Museo, Santa Cruz), and are more than 13,000 years old. In 1480 the [[Inca Empire]] conquered northwestern Argentina, making it part of the empire. In the northeastern area, the [[Guaraní]] developed a culture based on [[yuca]] and [[sweet potato]] however typical dishes all around Argentina are pasta, red wines (Italian influence) and beef.

Other languages spoken are Italian, English and German. Lunfardo is Argentinean slang and is a mix of Spanish and Italian. Argentineans are said to speak Spanish with an Italian accent.

== Politics ==
Argentina is a [[federal republic]]. The people of Argentina vote for a [[President]] to rule them and [[Senator]]s and [[Deputy|Deputies]] to speak for them and make laws for them. The President is [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] since December 2007.

== Administrative divisions ==
Argentina is divided into 23 [[province]]s (''provincias''; singular: ''provincia''), and 1 city (commonly known as ''capital federal''):

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Argentina}}
[[File:Argentina - Político.png|260px|thumb|left|alt=Map of Argentina|Map of Argentina]]

Argentina is almost 3,700&amp;nbsp;km long from north to south, and 1,400&amp;nbsp;km from east to west (maximum values). It can be divided into three parts: the [[Pampas]] in the central part of the country, [[Patagonia]] in the southern part down to [[Tierra del Fuego]]; and the [[Andes]] [[mountain range]] along the western border with [[Chile]], with the highest point in the province of [[Mendoza Province|Mendoza]]. [[Cerro Aconcagua]], at 6,960 metres (22,834 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]), is the [[Americas|Americas']] highest mountain.

The most important rivers include the [[Rio de la Plata|River Plate]], [[Paraguay River|Paraguay]], [[Bermejo River|Bermejo]], [[Colorado River (Argentina)|Colorado]], [[Uruguay River|Uruguay]] and the largest river, the [[Paraná River|Paraná]]. River Plate was incorrectly translated though, and should have been translated to English as River of (the) Silver. River Plate is also a famous Buenos Aires soccer team.

See [[List of cities in Argentina]] for the many places people live in Argentina.

== Other information ==
The majority of the Argentineans are descendants of Europeans mainly from [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], [[France]], other Europeans countries and [[Mestizo]] representing more than 90% of the total population of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html World Factbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Football in Argentina|Football]] or soccer is the most popular sport, although the national sport of the country is [[Pato]]. Argentina has a number of highly-ranked [[Polo]] players. Field hockey (for women) rugby and golf are also favorites.

Argentina is a [[Christian]] country. Most of Argentina's people (80 percent) are [[Roman Catholic]], but it is not the state religion.&lt;ref&gt;http://biblioteca.idict.villaclara.cu/biblioteca/colecciones-culturales/lit-argentina/argentina/poblacion/religion&lt;/ref&gt; Argentina also has the largest population of Jewish community after Israel and US. Many Middle Eastern immigrants who were Muslims converted to Catholicism, but there are still Muslims as well.

Medicine is socialized and so is education, making Argentina's literacy rate about 98%. State University is free as well.

'''Austria''' ({{lang-de|Österreich}}; officially called '''Republic of Austria'''), is a country in [[Central Europe]]. Around Austria there are [[Germany]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovenia]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Liechtenstein]]. Currently, the chancellor is [[Werner Faymann]]. Austria has been a [[state|member-state]] of the [[European Union|EU]] since [[1995]].

The people in Austria speak [[German language|German]], a few also [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. The capital of Austria is [[Vienna]] (Wien).

Austria is more than a thousand years old. Its history can be followed to the [[ninth century]]. At that time the first people moved to the land now known as Austria. The name &quot;Ostarrichi&quot; is first written in an official document from [[996]]. Since then this word has developed into the Modern German word ''Österreich''.

Austria is a democratic state and has nine federal states ({{lang-de|''Bundesländer''}}): [[Vorarlberg]], the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], [[Salzburg]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Styria]], [[Upper Austria]], [[Lower Austria]], [[Vienna]] and [[Burgenland]]. It is a [[neutral]] state, that means it does not take part in wars with other countries. Austria has been in the [[United Nations]] since 1955 and in the [[European Union]] since 1995.

== History ==
=== Ancient times ===
There has been human settlement in the area that is now Austria for a long time. The first settlers go back to the Paleolithic age. That was the time of the [[Neanderthal]]s. They left works of art such as the [[Venus of Willendorf]]. In the Neolithic age people were living there to dig for [[mineral]] resources, especially [[copper]]. [[Ötzi the Iceman|Ötzi]], a [[mummy]] found in a [[glacier]] between Austria and Italy, is from that time. In the [[Bronze Age]] people built bigger settlements and fortresses, especially where there were [[mineral]] resources. [[Salt mine|Salt mining]] began near [[Hallstatt]]. At that time, [[Celt]]s began to form the first states.

=== The Romans ===
[[File:Austria Romana.png|left|thumb|Map]]
====The Roman cities and their modern names====
The Romans came 15 B.C. to Austria and made the Celtic Regnum Noricum to a province. Modern Austria was part of three provinces, Raetia, Noricum and Pannonia. The border in the north was the Danube.

=== Modern times ===
Austria was the [[Austrian Empire]] from about 800 to [[1918]] and was ruled by The House of [[Habsburg]] for most of that period. Then it became a [[republic]]. The ''First Republic'' was from 1918 to 1938. From 1938 to 1945 Austria was part of Germany. The ''Second Republic'' was started in 1945.

== Geography ==
{{see also|List of settlements in Austria}}
[[File:Au-map.png|thumb|left|150px|Map of Austria]]
Austria is a largely [[mountain]]ous country since it is partially in the [[Alps]]. The high mountainous Alps in the west of Austria flatten somewhat into low lands and plains in the east of the country where the [[Danube]] flows.

== Culture ==

'''Armenia''' (officially called the '''Republic of Armenia''') is a country in the western part of Asia. Its [[capital (city)|capital city]] is [[Yerevan]]. Armenia received its independence from the [[Soviet Union]] in [[1991]].

Armenia touches [[Turkey]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Iran]].

There are some minorities living in Armenia, such as [[Greece|Greek]], [[Russia]]n, and other minorities, and more than 90% of the people are ethnic [[Armenians]].  Also, the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], is by far the largest religion in the country. There is a small amount of other [[Christians]], [[Muslims]] and [[atheists]].

Armenia is the place that some Christians believe [[Noah's Ark]] landed, and Noah's family settled.  The Armenian name for Armenia (Hayastan) means Land of Haik.  Haik was the name of a great-great-grandson of [[Noah]].

Throughout history, Armenia's size has changed many times.  Today Armenia is much smaller than it was once. In 80 BC, the Kingdom of Armenia covered parts of what is today Turkey, [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], Azerbaijan, and, of course, Armenia.

From [[1920]] to [[1991]], Armenia was a member of the [[Soviet Union]].

Today, Armenia's borders are locked with [[Turkey]] and [[Azerbaijan]], due to conflicts. In 1992, Armenia and Azerbaijan had a war over the land of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]]. The fighting stopped in 1994, and Armenia has had control over this land, but Azerbaijan still disputes about the land.

== Geography ==
Armenia is [[landlocked country|landlocked]] in the [[Transcaucasus|South Caucasus]]. It is between the [[Black Sea|Black]] and [[Caspian Sea]]s. The country is bordered on the north and east by [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Azerbaijan]], and on the south and west by [[Iran]] and [[Turkey]].

It covers an area of {{convert|29743|km2|sqmi|0}}. The land is mostly mountains, with fast flowing rivers and few forests. There are hot summers and cold winters. 

[[Mount Ararat]] used to be part of Armenia. It is the highest mountain in the region. It is now in Turkey, but clearly visible in Armenia. The Armenians see it as a [[symbol]] of their land. Because of this, the mountain is present on the [[Coat of arms of Armenia|Armenian national emblem]] today.

== Provinces ==
Armenia is divided into ten [[provinces]] and the capital city of [[Yerevan]].  As of 2007, Armenia includes 915 communities.  49 are considered [[urban]] and 866 are considered [[rural]].  For a list of communities see [[List of settlements in Armenia]].

'''Archaeology''' is the study of the [[past]] by looking for the remains and artifacts ([[history|historical things]]) left by the people who lived long ago. These remains can include old [[coin]]s, [[tool]]s, [[building]]s, and [[garbage]]. Archaeologists, the people who study archaeology, use these remains to understand how people lived.

Archaeologists think it is important to understand the past, because so many people use the past to know where they come from. 

==Fieldwork==
When archaeologists do fieldwork, they look for remains, often by digging deep in the ground. When things are found, or even when nothing is found, the results of the fieldwork are taken back to the place where the archaeologist's base is, maybe a [[university]] or [[museum]]. They record everything they found by writing down on paper or entering the information into a computer, so that they can build a picture of everything that is found. As [[Human settlement|settlements]] (places where people lived in groups) change and grow, old buildings are often buried to make space for new buildings. Ancient [[Rome]], for example, is now up to 40 feet (12 metres) below the present city. This is why archaeological fieldwork is expensive and why it takes a long time.

==Fields of interest==
[[Archaeologist]]s do not all study the same [[civilization]]s, they specialize in different areas of interest. Some fields of interest include [[Ancient Egypt]] (these specialists are called [[Egyptologist]]s), [[Ancient Greece]], or the [[Vikings]]. Archaeologists study every [[civilization]] that is known, especially the ones where there is no written [[history]]. They can study any time period. For example, one might study the beginning of human life in Africa, or one might study [[World War II]]. Some archaeologists study things that are now underwater. They search for [[shipwreck|sunken ships]] or [[city|cities]] that have been lost under the sea.
 
==Sites==
[[Stonehenge]], in [[England]] is a famous archaeological site, or place. Other famous sites include [[Angkor Wat]], [[Machu Picchu]], and [[Great Zimbabwe]]. In many countries, [[government]]s and other groups of people protect important sites so that they will not be destroyed and so that visitors can always come and see them.

Sometimes archaeological sites are found when [[foundation]]s are dug for new [[building]]s. Archaeologists have to work quickly when this happens, because people building often don't have a lot of time. Many times as soon as the archaeologists are done with their work, the remains that they have found will be covered over, unless they are very important.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The word '''application''' has several uses.

*In [[medicine]], 'application' means putting some [[drug]] or [[ointment]] usually on the [[skin]] where it is absorbed into the [[human body]].

*In [[computer software]], an application is a type of [[computer program|program]] which is designed for a particular [[wikt:simple:function|function]]. Example: [[word processing]].
 
*In [[business]] or [[government]], an application is a (usually [[paper]]) [[form]] filled out and handed in by a person seeking a [[wikt:privilege|privilege]] from a [[state]] or [[company]], such as [[Employment|work]], [[credit]], some type of [[license]] or [[permit]], or a [[house|place to live]].

*At work, generally [[engineering]], when dealing with certain [[material]]s or [[wikt:object|objects]], an &quot;application&quot; is a [[wikt:purpose|purpose]] that material or object can be used for. [[Wood]] and [[steel]] have many applications.

The '''animal''' [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], or '''Animalia''', contains living things which do not use [[light]] to get [[energy]] and [[growth|grow]], as [[plants]] do. The study of animals is called [[zoology]].&lt;ref&gt;Ville C.A; Walker W.F. &amp; Barnes R.D. 1984. ''General zoology''. Saunders&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Gina. ''Kingdoms of life – Animals''. Lorenz Educational Press. ISBN 978-1-4291-1610-7&lt;/ref&gt;

In one way or another, animals get their energy from other living things. They usually eat other living things, but some are  [[parasitism|parasites]], or have [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[protist]]s as [[symbiosis|symbionts]]. 

Like plants, animals are [[multicellular]] [[eukaryotic]] organisms, but animals are [[motile]], meaning they can move around. Animals take in [[oxygen]], and give out [[carbon dioxide]]. This is part of their [[metabolism]] (chemical working). In both these  ways they are different from [[plants]]. Also, the cells of animals have different [[cell membrane]]s to other eukaryotes like plants and [[fungi]].

== Grouping animals ==
There are many types of animals. The common animals most people know are only about 3% of the animal kingdom. When [[biologists]] look at animals, they find things that certain animals have in common. They use this to group the animals in a [[biological classification]].

Animals can mainly be divided into two main groups, the [[invertebrate]]s, and the [[vertebrate]]s. The vertebrates are animals with a [[backbone]], or [[spine]], and the invertebrates without.   

Vertebrates are:
*[[fish]] (or 'fishes': both ways are correct)
*[[amphibian]]s
*[[reptile]]s
*[[bird]]s
*[[mammal]]s

Some invertebrates are:
*[[insect]]s
*[[spider]]s
*[[crustacean]]s
*[[mollusc]]s (like [[squid]])
*[[worm]]s
*[[jellyfish]]

== Life styles ==
The animal mode of [[nutrition]] is called [[heterotroph|heterotrophic]] because they get their food from other living organisms. Some animals eat only plants; they are called [[herbivore]]s. Other animals eat only [[meat]] and are called [[carnivore]]s. Animals that eat both plants and meat are called [[omnivore]]s.   

The [[environments]] animals live in vary greatly. By the process of [[evolution]], animals get [[adapted]] to the [[habitats]] they live in. Obviously, a [[fish]] is adapted to its life in water, and a [[spider]] is adapted to a life catching and eating insects. A [[mammal]] living on the [[savannah]]s of [[East Africa]] lives quite a different life from a mammal like a [[porpoise]] catching fish in the sea.

The [[fossil]] record of animals goes back about 600 million years to the [[Ediacaran]] period. During the whole of this long period of time animals have been constantly changing, so that the animals alive on Earth today are very different from those on the edges of the sea-floor in the Ediacaran. The study of ancient life is called [[palaeontology]].

      <comment>Picked meaning: [[rate]] → [[rate (mathematics)]], [[negative]] → [[negative number]], [[move]] → [[Movement]]</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Acceleration''' is a [[measure]] of how [[speed|fast]] [[velocity]] [[wikt:change|changes]]. Acceleration is the change of velocity [[Division (mathematics)|divide]]d by the change of [[time]]. Acceleration is a [[vector]], and therefore includes both a [[size]] and a [[direction]].
 
== Examples ==
* An object was moving [[north]] at 10 meters per second. The object speeds up and now is moving north at 15 [[meter]]s per [[second]]. The object has accelerated. 
* An [[apple]] is falling down. It starts falling at 0 meters per second. At the end of the first second, the apple is moving at 9.8 meters per second. The apple has accelerated. At the end of the second second, the apple is moving down at 19.6 meters per second. The apple has accelerated again.
* Jane is walking [[east]] at 3 [[kilometer]]s per [[hour]]. Jane's velocity does not change. Jane's acceleration is [[zero]]. 
* Tom was walking east at 3 kilometers per hour. Tom turns and walks [[south]] at 3 kilometers per hour. Tom has had a nonzero acceleration. 
* Sally was walking east at 3 kilometers per hour. Sally slows down. After, Sally walks east at 1.5 kilometers per hour. Sally has had a nonzero acceleration.
* [[Acceleration due to gravity]]

== Finding acceleration ==

Acceleration is the [[rate (mathematics)|rate]] of change of the [[velocity]] of an object. Acceleration &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{{a}}&lt;/math&gt; can be found by using:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{{a}} = {\mathbf{v_1} - \mathbf{v_0} \over { t_1 - t_0 }}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_0}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity at the start
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v_1}&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity at the end
:&lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; is the time at the start 
:&lt;math&gt;t_1&lt;/math&gt; is the time at the end 

Sometimes the change in velocity &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v_1} - \mathbf{v_0}&lt;/math&gt; is written as Δ&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;. Sometimes the change in time &lt;math&gt;{ t_1 - t_0 }&lt;/math&gt; is written as Δt.

In difficult situations, the acceleration can be calculated using [[mathematics]]: in [[calculus]], acceleration is the [[Derivative (mathematics)|derivative]] of the velocity (with respect to time), &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{v}}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Units of measurement ===
Acceleration has its own [[units of measurement]]. For example, if velocity is measured in meters per second, and if time is measured in seconds, then acceleration is measured in meters per second squared  (m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

=== Other words ===
Acceleration can be [[positive]] or [[negative number|negative]]. When the acceleration is negative (but the velocity does not change direction), it is sometimes called deceleration. For example, when a car brakes it decelerates. Physicists usually only use the word &quot;acceleration&quot;.

== Newton's second law of motion ==
Newton's laws of motion are [[rule]]s for how things [[Movement|move]]. These rules are called &quot;[[law]]s of [[motion (physics)|motion]]&quot;. [[Isaac Newton]] is the [[scientist]] who first wrote down the main laws of motion.
According to [[Newton's laws of motion#Second Law|Newton's Second Law of Motion]], the [[Force (physics)|force]] something needs to accelerate an object depends on the object's [[mass]] (the amount of &quot;stuff&quot; the object is made from or how &quot;heavy&quot; it is).
The formula of Newton's Second Law of Motion is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F} = m \mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}&lt;/math&gt; is the force, and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; the mass. 
This formula is very well-known, and it is very important in [[physics]]. Newton's Second Law of Motion, in short &quot;Newton's Second Law&quot;, is often one of the first things that physics students learn.

== Deceleration ==
Deceleration is the opposite of acceleration. This means that something slows down instead of speeding up. For example, when a car brakes, it is decelerating.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Black pudding''' is an English name for blood sausage.  It is [[food]] made by [[cooking]] down the [[blood]] of any [[mammal]] (usually [[pig]]s or cattle) with meat, fat or filler until it is thick enough to [[congealing|congeal]] (become firm or solid) when cooled.

==Types of Black pudding==
[[File:Blutwurst.jpg|thumb|German ''Blutwurst'']]
In [[England]] blood sausage is called  ''Black Pudding''. The ingredients include pig's blood, [[suet]], [[bread]], [[barley]] and [[oats|oatmeal]]. The most common kind of German ''blutwurst'' is made from fatty pork meat, beef blood and filler such as barley. Though already cooked and &quot;ready to eat&quot; it is usually served warm.

Other kinds of blood sausage include ''boudin noir'' (France), ''boudin rouge'' ([[Creole]] and [[Cajun]]) and ''morcilla'' (Spain).

==History==
A [[legend]] says that blood sausage was invented in a [[gambling|bet]] between two [[Bavarian]] [[butcher]]s drunk on the alcoholic drink [[absinthe]] during the [[14th century]]. [[Homer]]'s ''Odyssey'' from Ancient [[Greece]] says that &quot;As when a man besides a great fire has filled a sausage with fat and blood and turns it this way and that and is very eager to get it quickly roasted...&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''boot device''' is used to start a [[computer]].  It is named after a [[boot]] which fits on the [[foot]].  The word [[bootstrap]] is also closely related, and means, to use something simpler to get something more complex to make itself work better. It comes from the English phrase &quot;pull yourself up by your own bootstraps.&quot;

Before a computer can operate normally, it must have [[operating system]] instructions that tell it how to perform basic functions.  A boot device loads the operating system into the [[memory]] of the computer. 

Devices that can boot a computer are usually '''boot disks''' or '''boot drives''' 
(normally a [[hard drive]], but can be a [[floppy disk]] or a [[compact disk|CD]]).  Some [[network computer]]s use ''boot chips'' that get the [[operating system]] over a [[network]].  [[Web phone]]s also use such chips to identify the user to the [[cell network]].  '''Boot card''' standards may let many users boot [[kiosk computer]]s with full [[privacy]] and access to all [[applications]] they own. There are also '''boot boards''' or '''boot ''add-in'' cards''' that are more permanent than boot cards.

Some people refer to the boot device as just a '''boot''' and non-boot devices as '''data device'''s, although it is not the [[computer]] but the [[operating system]] that cares about the difference between these.

==Origin==
The boot in '''boot device''' is the same as [[booting]] (or starting up). This is short for bootstrapping, or to start with simple stuff and make complex stuff out of it.

[[File:Wooden boots-Sanita-lightblue.jpg|thumb|100px|right]]
A '''boot''' is a type of [[footwear]] that protects the [[foot]] and [[ankle]]. Boots are higher and larger than [[shoe]]s and [[sandal]]s. Some boots are high enough to protect the [[leg|calves]] (lower part of the leg) as well.  Some boots are held on with ''bootstraps'' or ''bootlaces''.  Some also have '''spats''' or ''gaiters'' to keep water out.  Most have a very strong ''boot sole'', the bottom part of a boot.

== Types of boots ==
* '''Rain boots''' (or rubber boots) are made from [[rubber]] or [[plastic]]. Rain boots protect a person's feet from [[water]] and [[rain]]. People who work on [[fishing]] boats and [[farmer]]s wear rubber boots to keep their feet dry. People who work in [[chemical industry|chemical]] factories wear rubber boots to protect their feet from dangerous chemicals.

* '''Winter boots''' are boots that keep a person's feet warm in cold weather. People in cold countries such as [[Canada]] and [[Sweden]] wear winter boots during the cold season. Winter boots can be made from many different materials, such as [[leather]], [[fabric]], or [[plastic]]. Winter boots are [[thermal insulation|insulated]] with wool or fur to keep the feet warm. Most winter boots also keep people's feet dry.

* '''Work boots''' (or &quot;[[construction]] boots&quot;) are designed for people who work in construction or [[factory]] jobs. Work boots often have a steel toe cover to protect the person's toes. Work boots are usually made of strong leather, to protect the person's foot from sharp objects or dangerous chemicals. Some work boots have a flat piece of [[steel]] in the sole to protect the foot from sharp [[nail]]s. Many countries require construction workers to wear work boots when they are on a construction site.

== Other meanings ==
People in English-speaking countries refer to boots in a figurative or [[joke|joking]] manner when they tell someone &quot;to lift yourself up by your own bootstraps&quot;.  This is a joke because it is impossible for someone to lift themselves up by their own bootstraps. What the person is really saying is &quot;figure out your problem yourself&quot; or &quot;find your own way to better your situation.&quot;

As well, people sometimes use the term '''to bootstrap'''. This is an [[idiom]] meaning &quot;to use something simpler to get something more complex to make itself work better.&quot; The word [[Booting|&quot;boot&quot;]] is also used to describe how a [[computer]] starts up when a person presses the &quot;on&quot; button. 

Another term &quot;To boot&quot; is an [[idiom]] meaning [[wikt:also|also]].  For example, people say &quot;he had a beer, and a whiskey to boot.&quot; This means that the person had a beer, and also had a glass of whiskey. Another [[slang]] use of the word &quot;boot&quot; is to say &quot;Fred got the boot from the company.&quot; This means that Fred got [[unemployment|fired]] from the company.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bancruptcy''' is when someone or an organisation does not have enough [[money]] to pay all of its [[debt]] is insolvent. If it applies for protection by [[law]] it may then be '''bankrupt'''.  

In many countries a [[company]] or [[business]] can &quot;file for [[bankruptcy protection]]&quot; so that [[creditor]]s cannot destroy all of the [[physical capital]] and [[goodwill]] by breaking it apart and moving it away. All this provides is more [[time]] to work out a new deal between the owners and the people the business owes money. 
Often bankruptcy allows borrower to protect his personal belongings from creditor. After filing for bankruptcy and proving that he cannot pay off the debt, he will be freed from the liability to pay it off but it will be limited to borrow money again.

Very often, a [[creditor]] threatens a [[debtor]] with [[debt slavery]], if the debtor does not know that they have a right to go '''bankrupt'''.  This is a [[human rights]] problem in very many countries. Also, some creditors continue to bother a debtor even though bankruptcy laws say they should not, hoping that the debtor will pay them money that they wouldn't get.

== United States ==
Chapter 7 of the Title 11 of the [[United States]] [[Law|Code]] (Bankruptcy Code) control the bankruptcy laws of the United States. Chapter 7 is the most popular form of bankruptcy in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uscourts.gov/Press_Releases/2008/bankrupt_f2table_sep2008.xls&lt;/ref&gt; When a [[business]] is in [[debt]] and cannot pay it, it may ask or be forced to file bankruptcy in court under Chapter 7.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/109&lt;/ref&gt; A chapter 7 usually makes a [[company]] stop doing business. [[Employee]]s often lose their jobs when company files for chapter 7. When chapter 7 is filed, the [[trustee]] is chosen. The trustee is in charge of managing the [[business]] and selling its [[asset]]s to pay the [[creditor]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Breakfast sausage''' is a type of fresh [[pork]] [[sausage]] made from [[season]]ed [[ground]] [[meat]] mixed with [[bread]] crumbs. Breakfast sausage has a blander flavor than many other types of sausage, such as Polish or Italian-style sausages.

==Using breakfast sausages==
Breakfast sausages are not [[curing|cured]] or [[smoking|smoked]] like other types of sausages, which means that they have to be cooked soon after they are purchased (unless they are frozen).  Uncooked sausages should be stored in the [[refrigerator]] or the [[Refrigerator|freezer]]. Individuals handling them should wash their hands in hot [[soap]]y water, because uncooked pork is unhealthy for humans. Pork sausages have to be heated until all of the meat inside is cooked. 

They are usually [[Frying|fried]] or grilled in a pan until they are browned and served at [[breakfast]], often with cooked [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[pancake]]s, and [[toast]]ed bread. Breakfast sausages are also used in other dishes, such as &quot;toad in the hole&quot; a cooked batter dish.

==Types of breakfast sausages==
Different types made from pork and [[beef]] mixtures as well as [[poultry]] can now be found. There are also [[vegetarian]] types that use [[tofu|textured vegetable protein]] in place of meat. Breakfast sausages are available in patties or slices from a large roll, or in weiner-like links of different lengths and thickness.

[[Image:Giraffe feeding, Tanzania crop.jpg|thumb|Giraffe browsing]]
A '''browser''' is an animal, usually a [[herbivorous]] [[mammal]], which eats [[leaves]] and [[shrub]]s rather than [[grass]]. It is contrasted with [[grazer]]s, which eat grass.

'''Beekeeping''' or '''apiculture''' is the [[farming]] of [[honeybee]]s.

== Uses ==
The keeping of bees is usually, and has been in the past, for [[honey]]. That is becoming less true. Instead, it is more used for [[crop]] [[pollination]] and other products. These are [[:wikt:wax|wax]] and [[propolis]].

There is only one queen bee in each hive and she is bigger than the rest. She lays all the eggs, which makes all the other bees in the hive her daughters and sons. However, they do not control the hive.

== Types of beekeeping ==
The largest beekeeping operations are agricultural businesses that are operated for profit. Some people also have small beekeeping operations that they do as a [[hobby]]. Urban beekeeping is a growing trend, and some have found that &quot;city bees&quot; are actually healthier than &quot;rural bees&quot; because there are fewer pesticides and greater biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/jun/23/can-cities-save-bees&lt;/ref&gt;

==Threats==
[[Colony Collapse Disorder]] is a growing problem, along with [[mite]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''British English''' is the kind of [[English language]] which is used in the [[United Kingdom]], and in most countries which were in the [[British Empire]].

== Pronunciation in British English ==
In the United Kingdom, many different people say words in different ways. For example: a man from a place near [[London]] may not say his &quot;r&quot;s the same as a man from [[Scotland]] or a man from [[Northern Ireland]]. Across the country the accent is different. For instance in [[Liverpool]] one speaks with a &quot;scouse&quot; accent or in [[London]] one speaks with a &quot;cockney&quot; accent. Different variations on all of British English exist from the manner in which words are pronounced to the manner in which they are spelt. One place people speak English in a different way is [[Cornwall]], where the [[Cornish dialect]] is spoken. 

=== Other languages ===
Britain, like other countries, has languages other than English. In [[Wales]] many speak [[Welsh language|Welsh]]; in [[Scotland]] some people speak [[Gaelic]], and in [[Ireland]] a few people speak [[Irish language|Irish]]. However, that is not the subject of this particular article.

== Spelling in British English ==
British English often keeps more traditional ways of spelling words than American English. 

* Some British English words end in &quot;re&quot;, because the words were originally taken from [[French language|French]].  They are often simplified to &quot;er&quot; in American English
::British English: centre, litre, metre.
::American English: center, liter, meter.
* Some British English words end in &quot;our&quot; and are simplified to &quot;or&quot; in American English. The English spelling also came from the French language.
::British English: colour, favour, honour, labour
::American English: color, favor, honor, labor
* Some British English words the have come originally from the Greek language use &quot;ph&quot;. This has been changed to &quot;f&quot; in some other languages.
::British English: Sulphur, not Sulfur
* Some words in British English use &quot;s&quot; where &quot;z&quot; is used in American English. However, spelling them with &quot;z&quot; is also done in Britain.
::British English: colonisation, realisation, organisation
::American English: colonization, realization, organization
* The word &quot;[[gray]]&quot; is also a special case, as it can be spelled &quot;gray&quot; in American English and &quot;grey&quot; in British English. However, &quot;gray&quot; is also used in Britain.
* Many of these rules are also used in other countries outside of the [[United Kingdom]], mostly in countries that are members in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

== Vocabulary in British English ==
In British English, &quot;dock&quot; refers to the [[water]] in the space between two &quot;piers&quot; or &quot;wharfs&quot;. In American English, the &quot;pier&quot; or &quot;wharf&quot; could be called a &quot;dock&quot;, and the water between would be a &quot;slip&quot;.

Some common differences:

British – American
* accelerator – throttle
* [[autumn]] – fall
* [[biscuit]] – cookie
* bonnet – hood (of a car)
* [[boot]] – trunk (of a car)
* bum, arse – butt, ass
* [[car]] – automobile
* caravan – trailer, mobile home
* chips – [[French fries]]
* courgette – [[zucchini]]
* crisps – chips
* face flannel – washcloth
* flat – apartment
* [[football (soccer)|football]] – soccer
* garden – yard
* handbag – purse
* jumper – sweater
* [[lift]] – elevator
* lorry – truck
* manual gearbox – stick shift
* metro, underground, tube – subway
* motorway – freeway
* mum – mom
* nappy – diaper
* number plate – license plate
* pants - underpants
* pavement – sidewalk
* pram – stroller
* petrol – gas or gasoline
* phone box - phone booth
* post – mail, mailbox
* [[railway]] – railroad
* shifting – moving
* shopping trolley – shopping cart
* surname – last name
* take-away – take-out
* tap – faucet
* trousers – pants
* to let – to rent
* torch – flashlight
* tram – streetcar

== Usage in different countries ==
[[American English]] is only an official language in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] (less common, due to British influence). Although Commonwealth English is the most spoken, American English is seen more often on the internet. American English also dominates the visual media: &quot;movies&quot; (British: &quot;films&quot;) and television.

All [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] nations and Africa learn Commonwealth English, while American English is often learnt in the Americas and China. Z pronounced 'Zee' is only seen in the U.S.A and less commonly in Canada, while Z pronounced 'Zed' is spoken almost everywhere else. The United Kingdom and Ireland use British layout keyboards, while Australia, South Africa, Canada, New Zealand and the U.S.A use American layout keyboards. In continental [[Europe]] [[English as a second language]] is nowadays often American English, except perhaps in [[Scandinavia]] and [[Holland]].

:''Being is also a [[present tense]] part of [[to be]]''

The word '''being''' means the same as &quot;person&quot;. [[man|Men]], [[woman|women]], and [[child]]ren are [[human being]]s.

Some people write stories or make [[movie]]s about beings from other [[planet]]s. Most [[religion]]s talk about [[supernatural]] beings, for example [[spirit]]s, [[angel]]s, [[devil]]s, [[deity|gods]], or [[God]].

Being is something THAT IS.

[[File:Beijing in China (+all claims hatched).svg|thumb|Beijing in China]]
[[File:Beijing Financial Street (overlook).jpg|thumb|Beijing]]

'''Beijing''' ({{lang-zh|北京}}, Běijīng) is the [[Capital (city)|capital]] of the [[People's Republic of China]]. The city used to be known as '''''Peking'''''.  It is in the northern and eastern parts of the country.

The city of Beijing has played a very important role in the development of China. Many people from different cities and countries come to Beijing to look for better chances to find work. Nearly 15 million people live there. In 2008 Beijing hosted the [[Olympic Games]].

Beijing is well known for its ancient history.  Since the [[Jin Dynasty]], Beijing has been the [[Capital (city)|capital]] of several [[dynasties]], including the Yuan, Ming, Qing, and others.  There are many places of historic interest in Beijing.  These places include the [[Summer Palace]] (Yìhéyuán), the Temple of Heaven (Tiāntán), and the [[Great Wall of China]] (Chángchéng).

== What This Means==
Beijing means &quot;the northern capital&quot; in the [[Chinese language]].  It was once a counterpart of [[Nanjing]], &quot;the southern capital&quot;, during the Ming Dynasty.  This dynasty gave Beijing its name.  When the city does not serve as the capital city, the city reverts to its original name of Beiping, &quot;northern peace&quot;; this occurred between 1928 and 1949 when Nanjing was the capital of the Republic of China.

== History ==
The center of Beijing was settled in the [[1st millennium BC]]. In those days, the Kingdom of Yan (燕, Yān) set up their capital where Beijing is today.&lt;ref name=&quot;CD History&quot;&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.city-data.com/world-cities/Beijing-History.html |title=History - Beijing |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They called it Ji (蓟, Jì). After the Kingdom of Yan was destroyed, the city became smaller, although it was still an important place.

Beijing became more important again in the 10th century, when the Jin dynasty set its capital there. This city was destroyed by [[Mongol]] forces in [[1215]].  Then in [[1267]], Mongols built a new city on the north side of the Jin capital, and called it &quot;Great Capital&quot; (大都, Dàdū), which was the beginning of modern Beijing. When [[Kublai Khan]] the Mongolian monarch, set up the Yuan dynasty, this city became his capital.

The [[Yuan Dynasty]], [[Ming Dynasty]] and [[Qing dynasty]] all made Beijing their capital. When the Qing dynasty lost power and the Republic of China was set up, the new Republic moved its capital from Beijing to Nanjing. When the People's Republic of China seized power, Beijing became the capital of China again.

In 1989, there were [[protest]]s in [[Tiananmen Square|Tian'anmen Square]] because some people wanted [[democracy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CD History&quot; /&gt;

== Education ==
Beijing is the education center of People's Republic of China. More 500 famous universities of China are in Beijing.  They also  include 5 of the top universities: Peking University, Tsinghua University, China People University, Beijing Normal University and Beihang University. Beijing is also education center of China for teaching Chinese as a foreign language. The standard Chinese pronunciation is based on Beijing dialect, so over 70% foreigners who want to study Chinese go to Beijing for their studies.

The word '''berry''' is used for many different kinds of small [[fruit]]s that have many [[seeds]] and can be used as food. Some examples are [[raspberry]], [[blueberry]] and [[lingonberry]].

When [[botany|botanists]] talk about ''berries'', they mean a simple [[fruit]] produced from a single [[gynoecium|ovary]]. They sometimes call this ''true berry'', to distinguish it from ''false berries''. By that statement of how words are used, [[grape]]s or [[tomato]]es are true berries.

The berry is the most common type of soft fruit in which the entire ovary wall gets to the right stage of development of the [[pericarp]] which can be taken as food. The flowers of these plants have a upper ovary with one or more [[carpels]]. The seeds are inside the soft body of the ovary.

Berries are small, sweet, liquid, bright colored fruits. Due to this, they are able to bring more [[animal]]s towards them and spread their [[seed]]s.

Some fruits that are called ''berries'' in [[English language|English]] are not ''true berries'' by the use of words above. These include [[strawberry|strawberries]], [[blackberry|blackberries]], [[raspberry|raspberries]] and [[boysenberry|boysenberries]]. Some true berries do not have ''berry'' in their name. These include [[tomato]]es, [[eggplants]], [[cranberries]], [[guava]]s, [[pomegranate]]s and [[chile pepper|chillies]]. [[Pumpkin]]s, [[cucumber]]s, [[melon]]s, [[orange (fruit)|oranges]] and [[lemon]]s are also berries that have slightly different structure and may be called by different names ([[pepo]] for pumpkins, cucumbers, and melons, or [[hesperidium]] for oranges and lemons).

A '''beard''' is the [[hair]] growing on the lower part of a [[man]]'s [[face]].

The hair that grows on the upper [[lip]] of some men is a [[mustache]].  When a man has hair only below the lower lip and above the chin, it is called a [[soul patch]].  Some men have a lot of hair and a big beard, and some have very little. In the modern world, many men [[shave]] part or all of their beards, or cut their beard so it does not get very long. Women can also have beards, but it is less common. 

Some [[animal]]s also have hair like this, and people sometimes also call this hair a '''beard'''.

In light, '''black''' is lack of all [[color]].  In [[painting]], however, the black [[pigment]] is the combination of all colors.  In [[heraldry]], black is called &quot;sable&quot;.

==Origin of ''black''==
The word black comes from Old English blæc (&quot;black, dark&quot;, also, &quot;ink&quot;), from Proto-Germanic *blakkaz (&quot;burned&quot;), and from Proto-Indo-European *bhleg-. In many languages, ''black'' has the same meaning as ''ink''.

==Black in science==
In science, an object that is black absorbs the light that hits it. Because these objects do not reflect any light, the human [[eye]] can't see any color coming from that object. The [[brain]] then sees these objects as black.


A way to create black objects is to mix [[pigment|pigments]]. A pigment works by reflecting only the color of the pigment. For example, a blue pigment absorbs all colors except blue. By mixing pigments in the right quantities, black can be made.


Because black objects absorb light, they become warmer faster.

== Meaning of black ==

Black is associated with power, elegance, formality, [[anarchy]], death, evil, and mystery. Black is a dark color, the darkest color there is. Black, along with gray and white, is a ''neutral'' color. This means that it is not a ''hot'' color or a ''cool'' color.

Black is a color seen with fear and the unknown (black holes). It can have a bad meaning (blacklist, 'black death', black cat) or a good meaning ('in the black', 'black is beautiful'). Black can stand for strength and power. It can be a [[formal]], elegant, and high-class color (black tie, black Mercedes, black taco, black people). Black clothing is common in [[emo]] and [[goth subculture]].

'''Bubonic plague''' is the best-known form of the disease [[plague]], which is caused by the [[bacterium]] [[Yersinia pestis]]. The name ''bubonic plague'' is specific for this form of the disease, which enters through the skin, and travels through the [[lymphatic system]]. 

If the disease is left untreated, it kills about half its victims, in between three and seven days. The bubonic plague was the disease that caused the [[Black Death]], which killed tens of millions of people in Europe, in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/03/0310_040310_blackdeath.html|title=Bubonic Plague Traced to Ancient Egypt|first=Cameron|last=Walker|publisher=National Geographic News|date=10 March, 2004|accessdate=2 April, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Symptom]]s of this disease include [[cough]]ing, [[fever]], and black spots on the [[skin]].

== Different kinds of the same disease ==
There are different kinds of Bubonic plague. The most common form of the disease is spread by a certain kind of [[flea]], that lives on [[rat]]s. Then there is an [[incubation period]] which can last from a few hours to about seven days. 
=== [[Septicemic plague]] ===
[[Sepsis]] happens when the bacterium enters the [[blood]] and make it form tiny clots.
=== [[Pneumonic]] plague ===
This happens when the bacterium can enter the lungs. About 95% of all people with this form will die. Incubation period is only one to two days.

=== The abortive form ===
This is the most harmless form. It will result in a little [[fever]]. After that, there are [[antibody|antibodies]] that protect against all forms for a long time.

== History ==
During the 1300s, this [[epidemic]] struck parts of [[Asia]], [[North Africa]], and [[Europe]]. Almost a third of the people in Europe died of it. Unlike [[catastrophe]]s that pull communities together, this epidemic was so terrifying that it broke people's trust in one another. [[Giovanni Boccaccio]], an [[Italy|Italian]] writer of the time, described it: ''&quot;This [[scourge]] had implanted so great a terror in the hearts of men and women that brothers [[abandon]]ed brothers, uncles their nephews, sisters their brothers, and in many cases wives deserted their husbands. But even worse,... fathers and mothers refused to nurse and assist their own children.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;The decameron / Giovanni Boccaccio ; translated by Mark Musa &amp; Peter Bondanella ; with an introduction by Thomas G. Bergin. ISBN 0-451-52866-2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transmission ==
[[File:Flea infected with yersinia pestis.jpg|thumb|[[Oriental rat flea]] (''Xenopsylla cheopis'') infected with the ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' [[Bacteria|bacterium]] which appears as a dark mass in the gut. The foregut of this flea is blocked by a Y. pestis [[biofilm]]; when the flea attempts to feed on an uninfected [[Host (biology)|host]] ''Y. pestis'' from the foregut is [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitated]] into the wound, causing [[infection]].]]
The plague was not just carried by [[rat]]s as some people assume. The [[flea]]s also carried it. It came abroad from [[Kaffa]] by the [[Black Sea]]. From there the disease started to go new places in [[1347]]. It went to [[England]] in [[1349]]. There it killed '''half''' of the people in England. 70% of people who got plague died. Pigs are also to blame for the transmission, as the bacteria stayed in their blood system, and when eaten, people caught the plague. This is a reason why so few Jews or Muslims caught the disease.

== Modern history ==
In the [[20th century]], some countries did [[research]] on the [[bacteria]] that causes bubonic plague. They did research to use it for [[biological warfare]].

Samples of this [[bacteria]] are carefully controlled. There is much [[paranoia]] (fear) about it. Dr. Thomas C. Butler, a [[United States|US]] expert in this [[organism]] was charged in October [[2003]] by the [[FBI]] with various [[crime]]s. This happened after he said he lost samples of ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. This is the bacteria that causes bubonic plague. The FBI did not find the samples. They do not know what happened to them.

'''Biology''' is the [[science]] of life and living things, and their  [[evolution]]. Living things include [[plants]], [[animals]], [[fungi]] (such as [[mushroom]]s), and [[microorganisms]] such as [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]].

People who study biology are called [[biologists]]. Biology looks at how animals and other organisms behave and work, and what they are like. Biology also studies how [[organism]]s react with each other and the [[environment]]. It has existed as a [[science]] for about 200 years, and was preceded by [[natural history]]. Biology has many [[research]] fields and [[branch]]es. Like all sciences, biology uses the [[scientific method]]. This means that biologists must be able to show [[evidence]] for their ideas, and that other biologists must be able to test the ideas for themselves.

Biology attempts to answer questions such as:
&quot;What are the characteristics of this living thing?&quot; ([[comparative anatomy]]);
&quot;How do the parts work?&quot; ([[physiology]]);
&quot;How should we group living things?&quot; ([[classification]], [[taxonomy]]);
&quot;What does this living thing do?&quot; ([[behaviour]], [[growth]]);
&quot;How does [[inheritance]] work? ([[genetics]]); &quot;What has been the history of life?&quot; ([[palaeontology]]). How do organisms relate to their [[environment]]? ([[ecology]]). All modern biology is influenced by [[evolution]], which answers the question: &quot;How has the living world come to be as it is?&quot;

'''Belgium''', officially the '''Kingdom of Belgium''', is a [[Federation|federal]] [[sovereign state|state]] in Western Europe. It is a founding member of the [[European Union]]. It has the headquarters of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]] and some other famous organisations. The [[capital city]] of Belgium is [[Brussels]].  Belgium has an area of {{convert|30528|km2|sqmi}}.  There are about 11&amp;nbsp;million people.

There are three [[region]]s in Belgium: [[Flanders]] (where the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] speak [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) in the northern half of Belgium, [[Wallonia]] (where most people speak [[French language|French]]) in the southern half and the [[Brussels]]-Capital Region in the middle (where French is mostly spoken, with some Dutch).

The population is about 60% Dutch-speaking and 39% French-speaking, with a few German-speaking towns on the border with [[Germany]]. To look after both groups, Belgium has a complicated system of government.

==History==
[[File:Map-1477 Low Countries.png|thumb|left|The [[Seventeen Provinces]] (orange, brown and yellow areas) and the [[Bishopric of Liège]] (green)]]

The name 'Belgium' comes from ''[[Gallia Belgica]]''.  This was a [[Roman province]] in the northernmost part of [[Gaul]].  Before Roman invasion in 100&amp;nbsp;BC,  the ''[[Belgae]]'', a mix of [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples]], lived there.&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire]] |author=Bunson, Matthew

The [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568–1648) divided the Low Countries into the northern [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]] and the [[Southern Netherlands]].  Southern Netherlands were ruled by the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish]] and the [[Austria]]n [[Habsburg]]s.  This made up most of modern Belgium. 

After the [[French Revolutionary Wars: Campaigns of 1794|campaigns of 1794 in the French Revolutionary Wars]], the Low Countries were added into the [[French First Republic]].  This ended Austrian rule in the area. Adding back the Low Countries formed the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]].  This happened at the end of the [[First French Empire]] in 1815.

The [[Belgian Revolution]] was in 1830. &lt;ref name=Dobbelaere-VoyE&gt; {{Cite journal |url = http://socrel.oxfordjournals.org/content/51/Special_Issue/S1.full.pdf |title = From Pillar to Postmodernity: The Changing Situation of Religion in Belgium |page = S1 |publisher = ([http://www-oxford.op.org/allen/about.htm The Allen Review]).

The [[Berlin Conference]] of 1885 gave control of the [[Congo Free State]] to [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold&amp;nbsp;II]]. This was for him personally and not for the country of Belgium.  Starting in about 1900 many people did not like how he treated the Congolese people. In 1908 the Belgian state took control of the colony.  It was then called the [[Belgian Congo]].&lt;ref&gt; {{Cite book |title=The State of Africa |pages=95–96(?) |edition=Hardcover 608pp |date=6 June 2005 |author=Meredith, Mark |publisher=Free Press

Germany invaded Belgium in 1914. This was part of World War&amp;nbsp;I. The opening months of the war were very bad in Belgium. During the war Belgium took over the of [[Ruanda-Urundi]] (modern day [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]). After the First World War, the [[districts of Prussia|Prussian districts]] of [[Eupen-Malmedy|Eupen and Malmedy]] were added into Belgium in 1925. [[Battle of Belgium|The country was again invaded by Germany in 1940]] and under German control until 1944. After World War&amp;nbsp;II, the people made king [[Leopold III of Belgium|Leopold&amp;nbsp;III]] leave his throne in 1951. This is because they thought he helped the Germans.   

In 1960 the Belgian Congo stopped being under Belgian rule.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1304803 |title=The Congolese Civil War 1960–1964 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=29 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later Ruanda-Urundi also became free. Belgium joined [[NATO]] as a founding member. 

== Government and Politics ==
[[File:Prince Philippe of Belgium, Duke of Brabant cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Philippe of Belgium]], current King.]]
Belgium has a system of [[government]] known as a [[constitutional monarchy]], meaning that it has a [[monarch]], but that the monarch does not rule the country, and that a government is elected [[Democracy|democratically]].

Belgium has had its own monarchy since 1831. King [[Albert II of Belgium|Albert II]] left the throne on July 21, 2013 and the current king is [[Philippe of Belgium|Philippe]].

In Belgium, the government is elected. Between mid-2010 and late 2011, after no clear result in the [[election]], Belgium had no official government, until [[Elio Di Rupo]] became [[Prime Minister]]. [[Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]] both also have their own regional governments, and there is a notable independence movement in Flanders. [[Charles Michel]] is currently the Prime Minister.

== Geography ==
{{see also|List of cities in Belgium}}

Belgium is next to [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Luxembourg]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Its total area is 33,990 [[square kilometers]].  The land area alone is 30,528&amp;nbsp;km². Belgium has three main geographical regions. The coastal plain is in the north-west. The central plateau are part of the Anglo-Belgian Basin. The [[Ardennes]] uplands are in the south-east. The Paris Basin reaches a small fourth area at Belgium's southernmost tip, Belgian Lorraine.

The coastal plain is mostly [[sand dune]]s and [[polder]]s. Further inland is a smooth, slowly rising landscape.  There are fertile [[valley]]s. The hills have many [[forest]]s. The [[plateau]]s of the Ardennes are more rough and rocky.  They have caves and small, narrow valleys. Signal de Botrange is the country's highest point at 694 metres (2,277&amp;nbsp;ft).

===Provinces===
Belgium is divided into three Regions.  [[Flemish Region|Flanders]] and [[Walloon Region|Wallonia]] are divided into [[province]]s.  The third Region, [[Brussels Capital Region|Brussels]] is not part of any province.

'''Brazil''' (officially called '''Federative Republic of Brazil'''; how to say: {{IPA2|bɾɐˈziw}}) is a [[country]] in [[South America]]. It is the [[earth|world]]'s fifth largest country. The country has about 201 million people. The [[capital (city)|capital]] of Brazil is [[Brasília]]. Brazil was named after [[brazilwood]]. Brazilwood is a tree that once grew very well along the Brazilian coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fausto1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Boris Fausto|title=A Concise History of Brazil|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HJdaM325m8IC&amp;pg=PA9|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-56526-4|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first people to come to Brazil came around 9,000 B.C. That group of people is often called the South American Indians.  They probably came from [[North America]]. Some of them were hunters and gatherers, but others were farmers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://school.eb.com/levels/high/article/106094 |title=Brazil |website=Britannica School |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica |accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] was the first European to see Brazil. He saw it in 1500. He was from [[Portugal]] and the Portuguese government claimed Brazil. Soon, explorers explored the whole coastline of Brazil and colonies were set up. In the late 1500s and early 1600s the Dutch and the French would sometimes try to take land in Brazil. Brazilians started moving inland farther than the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] said they could. This caused some fights with the Spaniards and native people in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot; /&gt;

In 1822, Brazil claimed to be its own country and not a part of [[Portugal]] anymore. Soon there was [[civil war]]. But the emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] improved the economy, and in 1888, he freed the [[slavery|slaves]]. In 1889, there was a military [[coup]] and Pedro II had to leave the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot; /&gt;

In 1889, Brazil became a [[republic]]. It was not very democratic, because the only people who could vote where people who owned land. There were some uprisings in the 1920s because some people thought the government was unfairly helping coffee growers. Brazil joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot; /&gt;

During the 1960s, the leader [[Castelo Branco]] made the government like a [[dictatorship]]. Since then, the country has become more democratic, but some people feel that there are still big problems in health and education.  Brazil will be hosting the 2016 olympics.

==Languages==
Most people in Brazil speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Brazil is the only country in Latin America that speaks [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

Some people in Brazil speak [[German language|German]] dialects. That came from German immigrants. 0.8% of Brazilians speak German as their [[first language]].

Other people in Brazil speak indigenous Brazilian languages, [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[French language|French]], or [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]] and [[Aymara language|Aymará]] are the first languages of a small number of Brazilians.

== Geography ==
Brazil has the world's largest [[rainforest]], the [[Amazon Rainforest]]. It makes up 40% of the country's land area. Brazil also has other types of land, including a type of [[savanna]] called ''cerrado'', and a dry plant region named ''caatinga''.

The most important cities are [[Brasília]] (the capital), [[Belém (Brazil)|Belém]], [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Curitiba]], [[Florianópolis]], [[Fortaleza (Brazil)|Fortaleza]], [[Goiânia]], [[Manaus]], [[Porto Alegre]],  [[Recife]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[São Paulo]] (the biggest city) and [[Vitória (Brazil)|Vitória]].  Other cities are at [[List of largest cities in Brazil]].

Brazil is divided into 26 states plus the Federal District in five regions (north, south, northeast, southeast and centre-west):
*'''North''': Acre, Amazonas, Rondônia, Roraima, Pará, Amapá, Tocantins
*'''Northeast''': Maranhão, Pernambuco, Ceará, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, Alagoas, Sergipe, Bahia
*'''Centre-West''': Goiás, Mato grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Distrito Federal/ Federal District
*'''Southeast''': São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais
*'''South''': Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul

The country is the fifth largest in the world by area. It is known for its many rainforests and jungles. It is next to every country in South America except [[Chile]] and [[Ecuador]].

== People/culture ==

Brazil is the largest country in [[South America]] and the largest economy in [[Latin America]]. Its people include people of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] or other [[Europe]]an descent, [[Africa]]n descent, and [[Indigenous peoples|native Amerindians]], as well as many people of [[Mulatto|mixed origins]]. Brazil also has the biggest number of [[Japan]]ese descendents outside Japan. 

People from Brazil are called ''Brazilians''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=brazilian |title=WordNet Search - 3.0 |work=wordnetweb.princeton.edu |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''brasileiros'' in Brazilian Portuguese language).

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Chemicals in flasks.jpg|thumb|200px|Chemistry is the science of ''chemical elements'' and ''compounds''.]]
'''Chemistry''' is the [[science]] of [[chemical element]]s and [[Chemical compound|compounds]], and how these things work together. It is the study of the [[material]]s (things) that make up our bodies and everything in the world around us.

==History==
Before 1600, people studied substances to figure out how to do things such as turn lead into gold, but no one managed to do that. This was called alchemy. Alchemists (people that did alchemy) did discover some useful things, though. Sulphuric acid and nitric acid were two substances that they discovered.
Only a few elements were known. Some of them are mercury, silver, gold, and carbon.

Chemistry began as a true science during the 1600s. This is when chemists discovered the simplest [[substance]]s that make up all other substances. These simple substances are called elements. One of the things that they learned is that gold and lead are two different elements, so you can not change one into the other by a chemical reaction. The first element discovered after 1600 was [[phosphorus]], a strange white glowing solid.

Elements were discovered more and more rapidly. People separated the air into many parts and isolated the [[noble gas]]es from it. They also processed special minerals from a mine in [[Sweden]] to get [[rare earth metal]]s. [[Radioactivity]] was also discovered. Today chemists have discovered 118 different elements. Some are very common, like [[oxygen]]. Many are very rare and expensive, like [[platinum]]. Some cannot be found on earth and can only be made in labs, like [[rutherfordium]].

Since the 1920s, the increased understanding of [[physics]] has changed chemists' [[theory|theories]] about [[chemical reaction]]s.  With smaller and faster [[computer]]s, chemists have built better tools for [[Analytical chemistry|analyzing]] substances. These tools have been sent to study chemicals on [[Mars]].  Police also use those tools to study [[evidence]] from [[crime]] [[wikt:scene|scene]]s.

==Types of chemistry==
There are several types of chemistry. [[Analytical chemistry]] looks at which chemicals are in things. For example, looking at how much [[arsenic]] is in food. [[Organic chemistry]] looks at things that have [[carbon]] in them. For example, making [[acetylene]]. [[Inorganic chemistry]] looks at things that do not have carbon in them. One example is making an [[integrated circuit]].

A large area of chemistry is [[polymer chemistry]]. This looks at plastics. One example is making [[nylon]]. Because plastics are made of carbon, polymer chemistry is part of organic chemistry. Another area is [[biochemistry]]. This looks at the chemistry of living things. An example would be seeing how [[arsenic]] poisons people. Biochemistry is also part of organic chemistry. There are many other small branches of chemistry.

==[[wikt:concept|Concepts]] of chemistry==
===Basic concepts===
The basic unit of an [[Chemical element|element]] is called an [[atom]]. An atom is the smallest building block that you can cut an element into without the element breaking down (turning into a lighter element, for example through [[nuclear fission]] or [[radioactive decay]]). A [[chemical compound]] is a [[substance]] made up of two or more elements. In a compound, two or more atoms are joined together to form a [[molecule]]. The tiniest speck of dust or drop of [[liquid]], that one can see is made up of many millions or billions of these molecules. [[Mixture]]s are [[substance]]s where chemicals are mixed but not reacted. An example would be mixing sand and salt. This can be undone again to produce salt and sand separately. Chemical compounds are changed by a chemical reaction. An example would be heating [[sodium bicarbonate]], common baking soda. It will make water, [[carbon dioxide]], and [[sodium carbonate]]. This reaction cannot be undone.

===Mole===
A mole is a very large amount of atoms (602,214,150,000,000,000,000,000 atoms). The [[atomic mass]] of an element can be used to see how much of the element makes a mole. For example, the atomic mass of copper is about 63.55. That means about 63.55 [[gram]]s of copper metal has a mole of atoms. The atomic mass of chlorine is about 35.45. That means 35.45 grams of chlorine has a mole of atoms in it.

Moles can be used to see how many molecules are in chemical compounds, too. [[Copper(II) chloride]] is an example. CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is its chemical formula. There is one copper atom (63.55) and two chlorine atoms (35.45 · 2 = 70.90). Add all the molar masses of the elements together and the molar mass of the chemical compound is gotten. (63.55 + 70.90 = 134.45) That means in 134.45 grams of copper(II) chloride, there is one mole of copper(II) chloride molecules. This concept is used to calculate how much chemicals are needed in a chemical reaction if no reactants (chemicals that are reacted) should be left. If too much reactant is used, there will be some reactants left in the chemical reaction.

===Acids and bases===
[[Acid]]s and [[base (chemistry)|bases]] are common chemicals. Acids release H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; [[ion]]s when in water, and bases release [[Hydroxide|OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]] ions when in water. Acids can react with bases. The H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is taken from the acid by the base. This makes water, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. A salt is also made when an acid and a base react together. An example would be reacting [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) and [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH). Hydrochloric acid releases H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions in water. The base releases Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions. The H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and the OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; react to make water. There is a solution of [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) left. Sodium chloride is a [[salt]]. 

==Usefulness==
Chemistry is very useful in everyday life and makes up the foundation of many branches of science. Most objects are made by chemists (people who do chemistry). Chemists are constantly working to find new and useful substances. Chemists make new [[Medicine|drugs]] and materials like [[paint]]s that we use every day.

==Safety==
[[File:Cyril Ponnamperuma analyzing a moon sample.jpg|thumb|200px|This chemist is wearing safety [[glasses]], a lab coat and [[glove]]s. He is looking at a rock from the [[moon]].]]
Many chemicals are harmless, but there are some chemicals that are dangerous. For example, [[mercury(II) chloride]] is very [[wikt:toxic|toxic]]. [[Chromate]]s can cause [[cancer]]. [[Tin(II) chloride]] pollutes water easily. [[Hydrochloric acid]] can cause bad burns. Some chemicals like [[hydrogen]] can explode or catch fire. To stay safe, chemists experiment with chemicals in a chemical lab. They use special equipment and clothing to do reactions and keep the chemicals contained. The chemicals used in [[Medicine|drugs]] and in things like [[bleach]] have been tested to make sure they are safe if used correctly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Computer science''' is the study of how to manipulate, manage, transform and [[encode]] [[information]]. 

There are many different areas in computer science. Some of the areas consider problems in a more [[wikt:abstract|abstract]] way. Some areas need special [[machine]]s, called [[computer]]s.

A person who works with computers will often need [[mathematics]], [[science]], and [[logic]] in order to make and use computers.

== Common tasks for a computer scientist ==
=== Asking questions ===
This is so that they can find new and easier ways to do things, and the way to approach problems with this information.

=== Asking the right question ===
Computers can do some things easily (for example: simple math, or sorting out a list of names from A-to-Z). But computers cannot answer questions when there is not enough information, or when there is no real answer. Also, computers may take too much time to finish long [[wikt:task|tasks]]. For example, it may take too long to find the shortest way through all of the towns in the USA - so instead a computer will try to make a [[heuristic|close guess]]. A computer will answer these simpler questions much faster.

=== Answering the question ===
[[Algorithm]]s are steps of instructions describing how to complete a task, such as solving a problem. Think about [[playing cards]], for example. A computer scientist wants to sort the cards. First he wants to sort them out by color. Then he wants to order them by number (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace). The computer scientist may see different ways to sort the playing cards. He must now think about of how he will do it. When he decides, he has created an algorithm. After making the algorithm, the scientist needs to test whether the algorithm always does what it should. Then, the scientist can see how well his program sorts the cards.

A simple but very slow algorithm could be: drop the cards, pick them up, and check whether they are sorted. If they are not, do it again. This method will work, but it will often take a very long time.
 
A person may do this better by looking through all the cards, finding the first card (2 of diamonds), and putting it at the start. After this, he looks for the second card, and so on. This works much faster, and does not need much space. This sorting algorithm is a selection sort.

Computer science began during [[World War II]] and separated from the other sciences during the 1960s and 1970s. Now, computer science uses special methods of doing things, and has its own special words. It is related to [[electrical engineering]], [[mathematics]], and [[language science]].

Computer science looks at the [[theory|theoretical]] parts of computers. [[Computer engineering]] looks at the physical [[computer hardware|parts]] of computers (hardware), and [[software engineering]] looks at the use of [[software|computer programs]] and how to make them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If Wikipedia does not work at all, go to the [http://openfacts.berlios.de/index-en.phtml?title=Wikipedia_Status Wikipedia Status page on OpenFacts]. That page will tell you what is wrong and the [[developer]]s will say if they are fixing it. You could also check '''IRC''': #wikipedia on irc.freenode.net for when Wikipedia is closed for repairs. 

If you want to change Wikipedia, there is a page on OpenFacts where you can write Wikipedia pages and then move them here when Wikipedia is fixed.

If you only want to learn something at Wikipedia, '''[[Google]]''' keeps a copy of one version of every Wikipedia page (except redirect pages, but including pages resulting from redirects). Since Google checks the contents of pages once every one or two months, the saved version may not be the latest. Also, neither older versions are kept, nor the revision history listing. Thus, through Google one can still read and search the contents of Wikipedia, albeit not always the latest content; see below.

You can also visit sites which run fixed copies of Wikipedia whilst Wikipedia is down or visit the [[SchoolsWP:index:home|Wikipedia Selection for Schools]] which runs on a different machine. A fuller list of fixed copies is available at the open facts site listed above. 

== Google search of Wikipedia ==
By following the link below, you can use the [[Google]] search engine to search the English Wikipedia. Google keeps a copy of all namespaces and all language Wikipedias. When you find the page you want listed by google you need to click on &quot;cached&quot; to see the copy of the whole page.

Google updates its index about once a month, the search is based on the contents at that time!

The search is based on the text the browser shows, not on the source text which is seen in the Wikipedia edit box.

Using Google to search Wikipedia is faster. After finding an article, one can choose to view the current version or the cached one.  The cached version may not be the same as the current version on Wikipedia, but it is faster to view and is always available.

[http://www.google.com/custom?sa=Google+Search&amp;domains=wikipedia.org&amp;sitesearch=wikipedia.org Use Google to search Wikipedia]

It also searches many other language versions (those also on wikipedia.org), including Dutch, German and French, but not those on wikipedia.com, which include Afrikaans, Frisian, Italian and Simple English.

[[File:Computer-aj aj ashton 01.svg|thumb|A drawing of a usual desktop computer.]]
A '''computer''' is a [[machine]] that is able to take information ([[input]]), do some work on or make changes to the information, to make new information ([[output]]). Computers have existed for much of [[human]] [[history]]. Examples of early computers are the [[astrolabe]] and the [[abacus]]. 

Modern computers are very different from early computers. They are now very powerful machines that are able to do billions of calculations every second.   Most people have used a [[personal computer]] in their home or at work.  Computers are useful for many different jobs where automatic tasks are useful.  Some examples are controlling [[traffic light]]s, [[vehicle]] computers, security systems, [[Washing machines]] and Digital Televisions.

A person (called a user) can control a computer by telling it to do things.  Some ways of controlling a computer are with a [[keyboard (computer)|keyboard]], [[computer mouse | mouse]], buttons, [[touch screen]].  Some very new computers can also be controlled with voice commands or hand gestures.  

Computers can be designed to do anything with information.  Computers are used to control factories, which in the past were controlled by humans. They are also in homes, where they are used for things such as listening to music, reading the news, and writing.

Modern computers are electronic machines. A computer is only useful if it has both hardware and software.  Hardware is the physical parts the computer is made of - for example keyboard, mouse, screen, tower, and the circuits inside it.   Software is the computer programs (mathematical instructions). The software uses the hardware, when the user gives it instructions and changing it in to useful output.  

Many modern computers do billions of calculations each second.   They do mathematical [[arithmetic]] very quickly but computers do not really &quot;think&quot;.  They only follow the instructions in their software programs. 

Computer programs are designed or written by computer [[programmer]]s. A few programmers write programs in the computer's own language called [[machine code]]. Machine Code has only a few instructions and is based on [[logic]] and Mathematical arithmetic.  Using machine code is difficult for most human programmers. 

Today, programs are commonly written using a [[programming language]] like [[C++]], [[Java programming language|Java]], and [[Objective-C]].  These programming languages are more like the language you talk and write with every day. A program called a [[compiler]] translates the user's instructions into binary code (machine code) and turns it into useful information that a user can easily understand, and then the computer will understand the instructions and do what is needed.

== History of computers ==
[[File:Jacquard.loom.full.view.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Jacquard loom]] was one of the first programmable devices.]]

=== Definition ===
A computer is an electronic machine which helps in solving problems quickly and easily.It solves problems according to instructions given to it by the computer user.

=== Invention ===

The computer was invented by Charles Babbage. It is a digital machine used in all fields.

=== Automation ===

Humans have a problem with maths.  To show this, try doing 584 x 3,220 in your head.  It is hard to remember all the steps!  People made tools to help them remember where they were in a maths problem. The other problem people have is that they have to do the same problem over and over and over again.  A cashier used to make change every day in her head or with a piece of paper.  That took a lot of time and people made mistakes.  So people made machines that did those same things over and over. This part of computer history is called the &quot;history of automated calculation,&quot; which is a fancy phrase for &quot;the history of machines that make it easy for me to do this same maths problem over and over without making mistakes.&quot;

The [[abacus]], the [[slide rule]],  the [[astrolabe]] and the [[Antikythera mechanism]] (which dates from about 150-100 BC) are examples of automated calculation machines.

=== Programming ===
{{main|Computer programming}}
Some people did not want a machine that would do the same thing over and over again. For example, a music box is a machine that plays the same music over and over again. Some people wanted to be able to tell their machine to do different things. For example, they wanted to tell the music box to play different music every time. They wanted to be able to program the music box- to order the music box to play different music. This part of computer history is called the &quot;history of programmable machines&quot; which is a fancy phrase for &quot;The history of machines that I can order to do different things if I know how to speak their language.&quot;

One of the first examples of this was built by [[Hero of Alexandria]] (c. 10–70 AD). He built a mechanical theater which performed a play lasting 10 minutes and was operated by a complex system of ropes and drums. These ropes and drums were the language of the machine- they told what the machine did and when. Some people argue that this is the first programmable machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Most historians agree that the &quot;castle clock&quot;, an [[astronomical clock]] invented by [[Al-Jazari]] in 1206, is the first known [[Computer programming|programmable]] [[analog computer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ancient Discoveries&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=[[Ancient Discoveries]], Episode 11: Ancient Robots|publisher=[[History Channel]]|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxjbaQl0ad8|accessdate=2008-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It showed the [[zodiac]], the [[Heliocentric orbit|solar]] and [[lunar orbit]]s, a [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]]-shaped [[Pointer (computing)|pointer]] travelling across a gateway that made some [[door]]s to open every [[hour]],&lt;ref&gt;Howard R.

=== The Computing Era ===

At the end of the [[Middle Ages]], people in Europe thought math and [[engineering]] were more important. In 1623, [[Wilhelm Schickard]] made a mechanical calculator.  Other Europeans made more calculators after him.  They were not modern computers because they could only add, subtract, and multiply- you could not change what they did to make them do something like play Tetris.  Because of this, we say they were not programmable. 

In 1801, [[Joseph Marie Jacquard]] used [[punch card|punched paper cards]] to tell his [[loom|textile loom]] what kind of pattern to weave. He could use punch cards to tell the loom what to do, and he could change the punch cards, which means he could program the loom to weave the pattern he wanted.  This means the loom was programmable. 

Modern computers were made when someone ([[Charles Babbage]]) had an idea.  He wanted to make a machine that could do all the boring parts of math, (like the automated calculators) and could be told to do them different ways (like the programmable machines.)  [[Charles Babbage]] was the first to make a design of a fully programmable mechanical computer. He called it &quot;The [[Analytical engine|Analytical Engine]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Don't confuse the Analytical Engine with Babbage's [[difference engine]] which was a non-programmable mechanical calculator.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Babbage did not have enough money and always changed his design when he had a better idea, he never built his Analytical Engine.

As time went on, computers got more and more popular.  And that stands out at the beginning. This is because people get bored easily doing the same thing over and over.  Imagine spending your life writing things down on index cards, storing them, and then having to go find them again.  The U.S. Census Bureau in 1890 had hundreds of people doing just that. People got very bored and very frustrated, and would say, &quot;There HAS to be an easier way to do this.&quot; Then a clever person worked out how to make machines do a lot of the work. [[Herman Hollerith]] figured out how to make a machine that would automatically add up information that the Census bureau collected. The [[Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation]](which later became [[IBM]]) made his machines, and everyone was happy. At least, they were happy until their machines broke down, got jammed, and had to be repaired. This is when the [[Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation]] invented tech support.  

Because of machines like this, new ways of talking to these machines were invented, and new types of machines were invented, and eventually the computer as we know it was born.

== Analog and Digital Computers ==

In the first half of the 20th century, scientists started using computers, mostly because scientists had a lot of math to figure out and wanted to spend more of their time thinking about the secrets of the universe instead of spending hours adding numbers together. For example, if they had to launch a [[rocket ship]], they needed to do a lot of math to make sure the rocket did not blow up.

So they put together computers. These computers used [[analog signal|analog]] circuits, which made them very hard to program. Then, in the 1930s, they invented [[digital]] computers, which made them easier to program.  

=== High-scale computers ===

Scientists figured out how to make and use digital computers in the 1930s and 1940s.  Scientists made a lot of digital computers, and as they did, they figured out how to ask them the right sorts of questions to get the most out of them.  Here are a few of the computers they built: 

{{Early computer characteristics}}

[[File:EDSAC (10).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[EDSAC]] was one of the first computers that remembered what you told it even after you turned the power off.  This is called ([[von Neumann architecture|von Neumann]]) architecture.]]
* [[Konrad Zuse]]'s [[Electromechanics|electromechanical]] &quot;Z machines&quot;. The [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] (1941) was the first working machine that used [[Binary numeral system|binary]] arithmetic.  Binary arithmetic means using &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No.&quot; to add numbers together.  You could also program it.  In 1998 the Z3 was proved to be [[Turing complete]].  Turing complete means that it is possible to tell this particular computer anything that it is mathematically possible to tell a computer.  It is the world's first modern computer.
* The non-programmable [[Atanasoff–Berry Computer]] (1941) which used vacuum tubes to store &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; answers, and [[regenerative capacitor memory]].

* The [[Harvard Mark I]] (1944), A big computer that you could kind of program.
* The U.S. Army's [[Ballistics Research Laboratory]] [[ENIAC]] (1946), which could add numbers the way people do (using the numbers 0 through 9) and is sometimes called the first general purpose [[Electronics|electronic]] computer (since [[Konrad Zuse]]'s [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] of 1941 used [[electromagnets]] instead of [[electronics]]). At first, however, the only way you could reprogram ENIAC was by rewiring it.

Several developers of ENIAC saw its problems. They invented a way to for a computer to remember what they had told it, and a way to change what it remembered. This is known as &quot;stored program architecture&quot; or [[von Neumann architecture]]. [[John von Neumann]] talked about this design in the paper ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]'', distributed in 1945. A number of projects to develop computers based on the stored-program architecture started around this time.  The first of these was completed in [[Great Britain]]. The first to be demonstrated working was the [[Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine]] (SSEM or &quot;Baby&quot;), while the [[EDSAC]], completed a year after SSEM, was the first really useful computer that used the stored program design. Shortly afterwards, the machine originally described by von Neumann's paper—[[EDVAC]]—was completed but was not ready for two years.

Nearly all modern computers use the stored-program architecture in some form. It has become the main [[concept]] which defines a modern computer. Most of the technologies used to build computers have changed since the 1940s, but many current computers still use the von-Neumann architecture.

[[File:80486dx2-large.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Microprocessor]]s are miniaturized devices that often implement stored program [[CPU]]s.]]

In the 1950's computers were built out of mostly [[vacuum tube]]s.  [[Transistors]] replaced vacuum tubes in the 1960's because they were smaller and cheaper.   They also need less power and do not break down as much as vacuum tubes. In the 1970s, technologies were based on [[integrated circuit]]s. [[Microprocessor]]s, such as the [[Intel 4004]] made computers smaller and cheaper. They also made computers faster and more reliable. By the 1980s, computers became small and cheap enough to replace mechanical controls in things like [[washing machine]]s. The 1980s also saw [[home computer]]s and [[personal computer]]. With the evolution of the [[Internet]], personal computers are becoming as common as the [[television]] and the [[telephone]] in the household.

In 2005 Nokia started to call some of its mobile phones (the N-series) &quot;multimedia computers&quot; and after the launch of the Apple [[iPhone]] in 2007, many are now starting to add the [[smartphone]] category among &quot;real&quot; computers. In 2008, if the category of smartphones are included in the numbers of computers in the world, the biggest computer maker by units sold, is no longer Hewlett-Packard, but rather Nokia.{{fact|date=December 2008}}

== Kinds of computers ==
There are six types of computers:  personal computers, mainframes, laptop computers, mini computers, super computers and embedded computers.  

A &quot;desktop computer&quot; is a small machine that has a screen (which is not part of the computer).  Most people keep them on top of a desk, which is why they are called &quot;desktop computers.&quot; &quot;[[Laptop]] computers&quot; are computers small enough to fit on your lap.  This makes them easy to carry around. Both laptops and desktops are called personal computers, because one person at a time uses them for things like playing music, surfing the web, or playing video games. 

There are bigger computers that many people at a time can use.  These are called &quot;Mainframes,&quot; and these computers do all the things that make things like the internet work. You can think of a personal computer like this:  the personal computer is like your skin:  you can see it, other people can see it, and through your skin you feel wind, water, air, and the rest of the world.  A mainframe is more like your internal organs: you (hopefully) never see them, and you barely even think about them, but if they suddenly went missing, you would have some very big problems.  

There is another type of computer, called an embedded computer.  An embedded computer is a computer that does one thing and one thing only, and usually does it very well.  For example, an alarm clock is a embedded computer:  it tells the time.  Unlike your personal computer, you cannot use your clock to play Tetris.  Because of this, we say that embedded computers cannot be programmed, because you cannot install programs like Tetris on your clock. Some [[mobile phone]]s, [[automatic teller machine]]s, [[microwave oven]]s, [[CD player]]s and [[car]]s are examples of embedded computers.

===All-in-one PC===
All-in-one computers are [[PC|desktop computers]] that have the [[CPU]] and [[computer speaker|speaker]] in the same case as the [[Computer monitor|monitor]]. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] has made several popular examples of all-in-one computers, such as the [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]] of the mid-1980s and the [[iMac]] of the late 1990s and 2000s.

== Common uses of home computers ==
* Playing [[computer game]]s
* [[Writing]]
* Solving [[mathematics]]
* [[search engine | Looking]] for things on the [[Internet]]
* Watching [[TV]] and [[movies]]
* Listening to [[music]]
* [[Communication|Communicating]] with other people
* Downloading
* Sending [[e-mail]]
* Sorting
* Recording
* Calculating
* Editing
* Taking Pictures ([[photography]])
* Drawing

== Working methods ==
Computers store data and the instructions telling them what to do with the data as numbers, because computers can do things with numbers very quickly. These data are stored as [[binary]] [[symbol]]s (1s and 0s). A 1 or a 0 symbol stored by a computer is called a [[bit]], which comes from the words binary [[Numerical digit|digit]]. Computers can use many bits together to represent instructions and the data that these instructions use. A list of instructions is called a [[computer program|program]] and is stored on the computer's [[hard disk]]. Computers work through the program by using a [[central processing unit]], and they use fast memory called [[RAM]] as a space to store the instructions and data while they are doing this. When the computer wants to store the results of the program for later, it uses the [[hard disk]] because things stored on a hard disk can still be remembered after the computer is turned off.

An [[operating system]] tells the computer how to understand what jobs it has to do, how to do these jobs, and how to tell people the results. It tells the electronics inside the computer, or &quot;[[Computer hardware|hardware]]&quot;, how to work to get the results it needs. This lets most computers have the same [[operating system]], or list of orders to tell it how to talk to the user, while each computer can have its own computer programs or list of jobs to do what its user needs. Having different programs and [[operating system]]s makes it easy to learn how to use computers for new things. When a user needs to use a computer for something different, the user can learn how to use a new program.

== The Internet ==
One of the most important jobs that computers do for people is helping with [[communication]]. Communication is how people share [[information]]. Computers have helped people move forward in [[science]], [[medicine]], [[business]], and [[learning]], because they let experts from anywhere in the world work with each other and share information. They also let other [[wikt:people|people]] communicate with each other, do their jobs almost anywhere, learn about almost anything, or share their opinions with each other. The [[Internet]] is the thing that lets [[wikt:people|people]] communicate between their computers.

== Computers and waste ==
A computer is now almost always an [[electronic device]].  It usually contains materials that will become [[toxic waste]] when disposed of.  When a new computer is bought in some places, laws require that the cost of its [[waste management]] must also be paid for.  This is called [[product stewardship]].

Computers can become [[wikt:obsolete|obsolete]] quickly, depending on what programs the user runs.  Very often, they are thrown away within two or three years, because newer programs require a more powerful computer. This makes the problem worse, so [[computer recycling]] happens a lot.  Many projects try to send working computers to [[developing nation]]s so they can be re-used and will not become waste as quickly, as most people do not need to run new programs. Some computer parts, such as [[hard drive]]s, can break easily. When these parts end up in the [[landfill]], they can put [[poison]]ous chemicals like [[lead]] into the ground water. Hard drives can also contain secret information like [[credit card]] numbers. If the hard drive is not erased before being thrown away, an [[Identity theft|identity thief]] can get the information off of the hard drive, even if the drive doesn't work, and use it to steal money from the previous owner's bank account.

== Main hardware ==
Computers come in different forms, but most of them have a common design.
* All computers have a [[CPU]].
* All computers have some kind of [[data bus]] which lets them get inputs or output things to the environment.
* All computers have some form of memory. These are usually chips ([[integrated circuit]]s) which can hold information.
* Many computers have some kind of sensors, which lets them get input from their environment.
* Many computers have some kind of display device, which lets them show output. They may also have other [[peripheral equipment|peripheral devices]] connected.
  
A computer has several main parts. When comparing a computer to a human body, the [[CPU]] is like a brain. It does most of the 'thinking' and tells the rest of the computer how to work. The CPU is on the Motherboard, which is like the skeleton. It provides the basis for where the other parts go, and carries the [[nerves]] that connect them to each other and the CPU. The motherboard is connected to a power supply, which provides [[electricity]] to the entire computer. The various drives ([[compact disc|CD]] drive,  [[floppy drive]], and on many newer computers, [[USB flash drive]]) act like eyes, ears, and fingers, and allow the computer to read different types of storage, in the same way that a human can read different types of books. The [[hard drive]] is like a human's memory, and keeps track of all the data stored on the computer. Most computers have a [[sound card]] or another method of making sound, which is like [[vocal cords]], or a voice box. Connected to the sound card are [[computer speaker|speakers]], which are like a mouth, and are where the sound comes out. Computers might also have a [[graphics card]], which helps the computer to create visual effects, such as 3D environments, or more realistic colors, and more powerful graphics cards can make more realistic or more advanced images, in the same way a well trained artist can.

A '''continent''' is a large area of the [[land]] on [[Earth]] that is joined together. In general it is agreed there are seven continents: [[Africa]], [[Antarctica]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Australasia]] or [[Oceania]],&lt;ref&gt;Either are accepted terms&lt;/ref&gt; and [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/134805/continent Continent] (2009). In ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved 12 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NatlGeo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/places/continents/|title=Continents: What is a Continent?|publisher=[[National Geographic]]|accessdate=2009-08-22}} &quot;Most people recognize seven continents—Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia, from largest to smallest—although sometimes Europe and Asia are considered a single continent, Eurasia.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative versions ==
=== Australia ===
Some sources say that Australia is one of the seven continents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/as.html#Geo World fact book - Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; Others say that Australia is part of [[Oceania]].   [[Oceania]] is a region which includes [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[Pacific Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/au.htm Worldatlas.com - Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; The third alternative is the term [[Australasia]], which includes at least all countries on the Australian [[continental plate]]. This includes the islands of [[New Guinea]], [[Tasmania]], New Zealand and a number of smaller islands. It is on the south-eastern side of the [[Wallace Line]], with distinct differences in its biology from the Asian side of the line.

:&quot;It includes all the islands of the Malay Archipelago... as well as the various groups of islands in the Pacific. The term has been used in very different senses&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Alfred Russel 1893. ''Australasia'', vol 1. London: Stanford. Chapter 1: Definition.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North and South America ===
North America and South America are often described as &quot;the Americas&quot;. This has the advantage of including [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]] islands. Otherwise, Central America is counted as part of North America.

=== Eurasia ===
[[Eurasia]] is not really an alternative, it is a recognition that the landmass of Europe and Asia are continuous, and some of its largest countries are in both continents. [[Russia]] extends from eastern Europe to the far east of Asia without a break. The [[Ural Mountains]], which run roughly north/south, are the traditional dividing-line between Europe and Asia. For many purposes is is convenient to consider the great landmass as a single continent, Eurasia.

When [[Britain|British]] people talk about &quot;the Continent&quot; (or &quot;Continental&quot; things) they mean the [[Europe|European mainland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/continent.html |title=Encarta World English Dictionary |accessdate=2008-08-05 |year=2007|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc.|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwRKDyZ6|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meaning is not used as much as it used to be, but is still seen in phrases like &quot;Continental [[breakfast]]&quot; ([[bread|rolls]] with [[cheese]], [[jam]] etc. as distinct from an &quot;English breakfast&quot; which is a cooked breakfast).

Continents not only move but also sometimes move against each other. The Indian subcontinent has been colliding with the Eurasian continent for a while now. As these continents push against each other, they buckle and bend. Because of this, the [[Himalaya Mountains]], where [[Mount Everest]] is, are still being made today.&lt;ref name=holt&gt;{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Earth Science| publisher = Holt, Rinehart and Winston| date = 2001| location = United States of America| pages = 211| url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-03-055667-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] '''classical elements''' are fire, air, water, and earth. In Greek [[philosophy]], [[science]] and [[medicine]], these make up a whole.

*Fire is both hot and dry.
*Air is both hot and wet.
*Water is both cold and wet.
*Earth is both cold and dry.

The image below has two squares on top of each other. The corners of one are the classical elements. The corners of the other are the properties.

[[Galen]] said these elements were used by [[Hippocrates]] to describe the human body. The elements are linked to the four humours: phlegm (water), yellow bile (fire), black bile (earth), and blood (air).

In [[China|Chinese]] [[Taoism]] the elements are [[metal]], [[wood]], [[water]], [[fire]], [[earth]] ({{lang|zh|金、木、水、火、土}}).

'''China''' ({{zh|t=中國;|s=中国}} [[Pinyin]]: Zhōngguó) is a [[Culture|cultural]] [[region]], an [[Ancient history|ancient]] [[civilization]], and a [[nation]] in [[East Asia]].

The last [[Chinese Civil War]] resulted in two nations:
* {{flagicon|China}} The ''[[People's Republic of China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]]'', commonly known as ''China'', has control over [[mainland China]] and the largely self-governing territories of [[Hong Kong]] (since 1997) and [[Macau]] (since 1999).
* {{flagicon|Taiwan}} The ''[[Republic of China|Republic of China (ROC)]]'', commonly known as ''[[Taiwan]]'', has control over the islands of [[Taiwan]], [[Penghu]], [[Fujian|Kinmen]], and Matsu.

China has one of the world's oldest civilizations and has the oldest continuous civilization.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.emsc.nysed.gov/ciai/socst/grade3/whatisa.html&lt;/ref&gt; It has [[archaeology|archaeological]] [[evidence]] over 5,000 years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagg&quot;&gt;Haggett, Peter. [2001] (2001). Encyclopedia of World Geography, Volume 23. Edition 2, illustrated. Marshall Cavendish publishing. ISBN 0-7614-7289-4, 9780761472896. p 37. p 2836.&lt;/ref&gt; It also has one of the world's oldest [[Chinese character|writing systems]], and is viewed as the source of many major [[inventions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagg&quot; /&gt;

==Origins==
The first recorded use of the word &quot;China&quot; is dated 1555.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Eden, Richard. ''Decades of the New World'' (1555) 'The great China whose kyng is thought the greatest prince in the world.'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OnlineEty&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=china China]&quot;, ''Online Etymology Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from ''Cin'', a Persian name for China popularized in Europe by [[Marco Polo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OnlineEty&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wood&quot;&gt;Wood, Francis, ''Did Marco Polo go to China'' (1995), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of China}}
[[Ancient China]] was one of the first [[civilization]]s and was active since the [[2nd millennium BC]] as a [[feudalism|feudal]] [[society]]. Chinese civilization was also one of the few to invent [[writing]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagg&quot; /&gt; the others being [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus Valley civilization]], the [[Maya civilization]], the [[Minoan civilization]] of [[ancient Greece]], and [[Ancient Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Gernet, Jacques. [1996] (1996). A history of Chinese civilization Edition 2, illustrated. Cambridge University Press. ISBN 0-521-49781-7, 9780521497817. p 40.&lt;/ref&gt; It reached its golden age during the [[Tang Dynasty]] (about A.D. 10th century). China is home to some of the oldest artwork in the world. Statues and pottery, as well as decorations made of [[jade]], are some classic examples.

Its land area has mostly looked like that of modern China, except with northern and western edges that varied.  It was often attacked by northern people, such as [[Genghis Khan]] and [[Kublai Khan]].  While China achieved many things in the [[First millennium]] and early [[2nd millennium]], it became an [[isolationism|isolationist]] country in the [[15th century|15th century C.E.]]  

By the [[Renaissance]], European powers started to take over other countries in Asia.  While China was never actually taken over, many [[Europe]]an [[countries]], such as [[Britain]] and [[France]] built [[spheres of influence]] in China.  Since China had cut itself off from the world over the previous few [[centuries]], by the [[Qing Dynasty]], it had fallen behind other countries in [[technology]], and was helpless to stop this from happening.  This had become clear when it lost the [[Opium Wars]] to [[Britain]] in the [[19th century]].  

In 1911, the Republic of China was founded by [[Sun Yat-sen]], but its government was very weak. [[Warlord]]s controlled many areas. [[Chiang Kai-shek]] led wars against them, and became President and dictator.

In 1931, Japan invaded [[Manchuria]], a place in the northeastern part of China. On July 7, 1937, the Japanese attacked the rest of the country, starting what was called the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. The war later became part of [[World War II]]. The war was fought for eight years and millions of Chinese people were killed. In 1945, after the United States dropped atomic bombs on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], Japan surrendered.

However, the [[Chinese Civil War]] later started between the [[Kuomintang]] (Nationalists) of the [[Republic of China]] (ROC) and the Communists of the People's Republic of China (PRC). The Communists wanted to make China like the Soviet Union, whereas the other side wanted to keep China in its current state at the time. The Chinese Civil War was going on throughout World War II. The Communists were led by [[Mao Zedong]], Liu Shaoqi and others. Later Liu lost influence with Mao and his death to this day remains unresolved. The Communists eventually won the war. The Nationalists (led by Chiang Kai-shek) fled to the island of Taiwan and set up their new capital city in Taipei. After the Chinese Civil War, the Communist leader Mao Zedong declared a new country, the People's Republic of China (PRC), in Beijing on October 1, 1949.

Under Mao the country stayed poor while Taiwan became richer. His attempt at [[industrialization]] with the [[Great Leap Forward]] led to the deaths of many people from [[famine]]. The [[Cultural Revolution]] caused great social upheaval. Following his death in 1976, China underwent open market reforms under [[Deng Xiaoping]], and experienced rapid economic growth. China is now one of the largest economies in the world, relying mainly on exports.

In recent history, China has had problems with protests, blocking of information on the [[Internet]], and [[censorship]] in the news. 1989 was notable for the government killing thousands of protesters with tanks in Beijing.

== Culture ==
China is the origin of Eastern [[martial art]]s, called [[Kung-fu|Kung Fu]] or its first name [[Wushu]]. China is also the home of the well-respected [[Spa Monastery]] and [[Wudang Mountains]]. Martial art started more for the purpose of [[survival]] and [[war]]fare than [[art]]. Over time some [[art form]]s have branched off, while others have retained their distinct Chinese flavor. 

China has had renowned [[artist]]s including [[Wong Fei Hung]] ([[Huang Fei Hung]] or [[Hwang Fei Hung]]) and many others. [[Art]] has also co-existed with a variety of [[paint]]s including the more standard 18 colors. Legendary and controversial moves like [[Big Mak]] are also praised and talked about within the [[culture]].

China has many traditional [[festival]]s, such as Spring Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-autumn Festival and so on. The most significant is [[Chinese New Year]]. People in China will have holidays to celebrate these festivals.

=== Festivals ===
Spring Festival is the Chinese New Year. It lasts fifteen days. It starts with the first day of the Chinese lunar year and ends with the full moon fifteen days later. On the first day of the Spring Festival, people call on friends and relatives. Because most of people watch the Spring Festival Celebrations on CCTV all the night on New Year's Eve and don't go to bed until 12:00 AM, they usually get up later in the next day. The fifth day of the Spring Festival is the day to welcome the god of Wealth (Chinese:财神爷), many people make and eat dumplings (Chinese:饺子). They believe that dumplings can hold the god of Wealth and bring luck.The last day of the Spring Festival is the Lantern Festival. On this day, the moon becomes the full moon. People go out and watch the lantern festivals everywhere. After that, they eat sweet dumpling (Chinese:汤圆,元宵), a kind of dumpling which is round and looks like the full moon.

Dragon Boat Festival is celebrated to commemorate the death of Qu Yuan, a patriotic poet of the State of Chu during the [[Warring States]] period. He persuaded his emperor not to accept Qin's diplomats' offers several times but his emperor did not listen to him. He was very sad and ended up jumping into the river to end his life. The people loved him so much that they did not want the fish to eat his corpse. They made and threw rice dumplings into the river. They hope the fish eat these dumplings instead of the poet's corpse. They also rowed dragon boats in the river to get rid of the fish. Such practices, eating rice dumplings and holding dragon boat races, become what Chinese do in this festival nowadays.

Held on the fifteenth day of the eighth lunar month, Mid-Autumn Festival is a festival for families. Now when the festival sets in, people would sit together to eat moon cakes, appreciate the bright full moon cakes, appreciate the bright full moon, celebrate the bumper harvest and enjoy the family love and happiness. To the Chinese people, the full moon symbolizes family reunion, as does the &quot;moon cakes.&quot; Hence the Mid-Autumn Festival is also called the Family Reunion Festival.

==Fair use==
There is an [[wikt:exception|exception]] to the rules of copyright, which is called [[fair use]]. This says that we can copy a ''short'' amount of something (for example, one or two sentences, or a small picture) without permission. Fair use is part of the laws of [[United States of America]] and some other countries. This should only be done if you are going to write about the part that was copied. 

Because people could get very angry at the Wikipedia if we copy the wrong things, it is better not to copy anything onto the Wikipedia unless we are sure it is allowed.

==Moving things from other Wikipedias==
We can move things from other Wikipedias to here. Text from other Wikipedias is copyrighted and we can only use it if we follow the rules of the [[GFDL]]. According to the GFDL, you must provide attribution (that means, you must say where you got it from) when using someone else's work.

This means that copying between pages (or projects) is OK. When the changes you make are more than just making the words correct, copyright is not kept; this makes you a ''co-author''. You must show respect to the people who wrote what you are copying by saying they did this work. You can do this by writing in your [[Wikipedia:Edit summary|edit summary]] where you have copied the work from. You can also add a note in the article or on the Talk page.

==Copyright does not apply in some cases==
Copyright does not apply is some cases. These are the ones that are probably relevant here:
*There needs to be enough creativity (called ''threshold of originality''). This means that when something is done in a way that is not creative, it cannot be copyrighted. An example would be an alphabetical listing of people's phone numbers.&lt;sup&gt;[[:en:Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service|[REF]]]&lt;/sup&gt;
*There is a time limit on copyright.  If something was created a long time ago, the copyright of it may have [[wikt:expired|expired]].
*Things that are commonly known can usually not be copyrighted. 
*In the context of texts: Very short texts (only a few words long) cannot be copyrighted; please note that this does not apply to [[music]]: [[jingle]]s are very short pieces of music. They allow someone to identify a certain company or product, they can be copyrighted.

'''Cartography''' is making [[map]]s. Cartography is part of [[geography]].
How people make maps is always changing. In the past, maps were drawn by hand, but today most printed maps are made using [[computer]]s. Someone who makes maps is called a cartographer.

Making a map can be as simple as drawing a direction on a napkin, or as complicated as showing a [[census]] of a whole country. Anyone can make a map, but there are people who spend their lives learning how to make complicated maps.

[[Old fashioned]] maps were usually carefully drawn onto a piece of paper. The reason they look old is because they have been well used or have been through rough conditions.

Nowadays they are made on a [[computer]] because it means they look neater with accurate images.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''Creator''' is a person who [[create]]s something.

In some [[religion]]s ([[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], [[Islam]]) [[God]] (or [[Allah]] meaning '''the God''' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]]) is the most important and original '''Creator''' of the whole [[Universe]] - including [[Man]] who is made &quot;in his image&quot; (see [[Genesis]]) to [[Astronomy|observe]] it and [[control]] it like God. The idea that anything that a person is [[creating]], like an [[idea]], can be [[ownership|owned]] as [[property]] comes from the [[ethical tradition]]s and [[legal code]]s that came from these religions.

In other traditions ([[Buddhism]], [[Native American mythology]]) anyone has this potential for creating, and can become part of the greater creating of the [[universe]]. {{fact|date=January 2013}}[[Stewardship]] of home, [[Ecological footprint|land and all of Earth]] is a test for participating in this, or just good sense.

'''Chorizo''' is a [[pork]] (pig-meat) [[sausage]] which people first made in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. It is made with large pieces of fatty pork, [[chili pepper]] and [[paprika]]. The special taste of this sausage comes from the mild Spanish paprika in it. 

In the western hemisphere, the [[Mexico|Mexican]] and [[Caribbean]] types are better known. These types of chorizo are made with smaller pieces of pork and different seasonings and peppers are used.

Cured smoked chorizo can be [[Eating|eaten]] without [[cooking]]. Fresh chorizo must be cooked before eating. It can be eaten by its self, or as part of [[meal]]. It can also be used in place of ground [[beef]] or pork.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Creativity''' is the [[ability]] of a person or group to make something new and useful or valuable, or the [[process]] of making something new and useful or valuable. It happens in all areas of life - science, art, literature and music. As a personal ability it is very difficult to [[measure]]. The reason is that we don't understand the mental processes that help some people be more creative than others. Judging what is creative is also controversial. Some people say only things which are historically new are creative, while other people say that if it is new for the creator and the people around them, then it is also creativity.

Some think creativity is an important thing that makes [[human]]s different from [[ape]]s. Others recognize that even apes, other [[primates]], other [[mammal]]s and some birds [[adapt]] to [[survive]] by being creative (for example - primates using tools). [[Liane Gabora]] believes that all [[culture]] comes from creativity, not [[imitation]]. Therefore, these people say, [[human science]] should focus on it (pay special attention to it): [[Ethics]] for example would focus on finding creative [[solution]]s to [[ethical dilemma]]s. [[Politics]] would focus on the [[political virtues]] that need some creativity. Imitation would not be the focus of [[education]]. [[Linguistics]] might be more interested in how new words are created by culture, rather than in how existing ones are used in [[grammar]].

[[Intellectual interests]] (recognized as [[intellectual rights]] or [[intellectual property]] in the [[law]]) are a way to [[reward]] creativity in law, but they do not always work very well. A good example is [[copyright]] which is supposed to pay [[author]]s and [[artist]]s, but may only pay [[lawyer]]s to make (imitative) arguments in [[court]].

Creativity is a central question in [[economics]], where it is known as '''ingenuity''' (the ability to come up with new ideas) or '''individual capital''' - [[capacity|capacities]] that [[individual]]s have, that do not arise from simple imitation of what is known already. This is separate from the [[instructional capital]] that might try to [[capture]] some of that in a [[patent]] or [[training]] system that helps others do what the individual leader or [[wikt:founder|founder]] of the system can do. In [[urban economics]] there are various ways to measure creativity - the [[Bohemian Index]] and [[Gay Index]] are two attempts to do this [[wikt:accurate|accurately]] and [[predict]] the [[economic growth]] of [[city|cities]] based on creativity.

[[File:Cathars expelled.JPG|thumb|right|The cathars are expelled from [[Carcassonne]], in the year 1209]]
[[File:Château de Peyrepertuse - Enceinte basse et éperon (est).jpg|thumb|right|The lower, older part of Castle [[Peyrepertuse]]. This castle was one of the last Cathar strongholds to fall]]

The '''Cathar''' [[wikt:faith|faith]] was a version of [[Christianity]]. They were usually considered [[Gnosticism|Gnostics]]. The word 'Cathar' comes the Greek word ''katharos'' meaning 'unpolluted' (from Tobias Churton, ''The Gnostics'') or  &quot;the pure ones&quot;.

== Principles ==
The Cathars believed that the world had been made by a bad god.  They believed that this bad god had taken them from the good god and put them in the world, but inside their bodies there was a spirit, and that spirit needed to return to the good god.  They were famous for a belief in a form of [[reincarnation]] and believed that when someone died the bad god would put that person's spirit in a new body. They believed this cycle of coming back to life could be escaped by a ritual cleansing.  They were opposed to the doctrine of [[sin]].  

[[Women]] were prominent in the faith.  They were [[pacifist]]s.  They didn't eat anything that was made from other animals, including meat and [[milk|cows milk]]. The only [[wikt:exception|exception]] to this was [[fish]]. Fish was OK to eat because they believed fishes were not alive but just things that were sometimes produced from dirt and water.

They preached tolerance of other faiths.  They rejected the usual Christian rules of [[marriage]] and only believed in the New Testament.  An earlier 10th century Bulgarian heresy, [[Bogomilism]] and also [[Manichaeism]] started some of these trends.  

=== Language ===
They used a bible in the language people spoke. Many other Christians used a Bible in [[Latin language|Latin]]. Latin was spoken only by the [[priest]]s.

== Problems ==
In 1145, open challenge to Catholic dominance began.  In about 1165, the first Cathars said that the Church was &quot;full of ravening (starving) wolves and hypocrites&quot; and &quot;worshipping the wrong God&quot;, right in front of the most powerful Catholics. In 1166, the [[Council of Oxford]] in [[England]] wiped out the English Cathars.  It was also suppressed in Northern France.  In 1167, Cathar [[bishop]]s met to discuss organizing a counter Church - in the South of France, the Languedoc nobles protected it, and many noble women became &quot;Perfects&quot;.  Parish clergy had low [[morale]], or confidence.

=== Reactions ===
The [[Catholic Church]] was against Catharism, seeing it as a heresy.

In the South of France there was tremendous [[religious fervor]], and an [[economy]] that was starting to grow, and a social class of  [[merchant]]s and  [[peasant]]s was starting to grow.  Peasants owned their own [[land]].  Meanwhile, in other parts of [[Europe]], peasants were forced to give up their land to [[noble]]s and become [[serf]]s or [[slave]]s - the system of [[feudalism]].  There was a strong central [[absolute monarchy]] that did not exist in the South of France.  The [[burgher]]s and [[banker]]s had more power in this looser system.  [[R. I. Moore]] is a historian who believes that it was desire to crush this system and take over the land that drove the attack.

However, there was real cultural and religious difference to cause problems:  [[Troubador]]s, who combined some of the traditions of the [[Bard]]s of the [[Celt]]s, and [[Jew]]s, were both part of the multicultural society in the South of [[France]].  Their influences were not appreciated by local or Roman Church figures.  The 12th century Roman Catholic [[Monk]]s were founding their [[monastery|monasteries]] outside the towns, drawing the best people there.

=== Results ===
The Cathars thus had little competition.  The Cathar &quot;Perfects&quot;, the so-called Good Men or Good Women, lived restrained lives and spread their faith in towns - where the Catholics in general did not have their best agents.  Also, Cathars preached that only these Good leaders had to follow the regimens their whole lives - lay people could repent only on their deathbeds.  Many 20th century [[Christian sect]]s have similar beliefs.

== The Albigensian Crusade ==
=== Methods ===
The Pope ordered a crusade against the Cathars in southern France.  He said any crusader who answered the call would be given the same rewards as a crusader who went to the Holy Land.  This was an [[absolution]] of all sin.

In the [[Launguedoc]], on the 22nd of July 1209, a force of about 30,000 [[Crusader]]s arrived at the walls of Beziers bearing the cross pattee to mislead and create ease among the Cathars, thinking they were friend, not foe, and  demanded that about 200 Cathars be surrendered.  The people of the town who were mostly Catholic, said that rather than turn over their friends and family, &quot;we would rather be [[flaying|flayed alive]].&quot;  

A mistake by the defenders of [[Beziers]] let thousands of attackers in. Arnauld Amaury made the famous quote &quot;Kill them all, god knows his own&quot;  on being asked how to tell who were Cathars during the assault. Everyone in the town was killed, some while taking refuge in the church.  It is guessed that 20,000 were killed, many of whom were Catholics and not Cathars at all.  The crusade became known as the '''[[Albigensian crusade]]''' after the town of [[Albi]].  It was to wipe out the Cathars almost entirely over forty or so years.  The Crusaders wanted to go home, but were ordered by the Pope to continue until the whole South of France was controlled and all Cathars were dead. In 1210, they attacked the fortress at [[Minerv]] and built &quot;the first great bonfire of heretics&quot; - beginning the practice of [[Pyre|burning at the stake]] that would continue in the [[Inquisition]] of the [[Counter-Reformation]]. It is interesting to note that at the siege of Montsegur when the fires were lit the Cathars ran down the hill and threw themselves on, as their beliefs were very strong.

===Result===
Catharism disappeared from the northern Italian cities after the 1260s, pressured by the Inquisition. The last known Cathar perfectus in the Languedoc, [[Guillaume Bélibaste]], was killed in 1321.

'''Cosmology''' is the branch of [[astronomy]] that deals with the origin, structure, evolution and space-time relationships of the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cosmology&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Collins Dictionary of Astronomy|publisher=HarperCollins|date=2012|origyear=2006|edition=Fifth|first1=John|last1=Daintith|first2=William|last2=Gould|isbn=9780007918485|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA defines cosmology as &quot;The study of the structure and changes in the present universe&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NASA&quot;&gt;[http://genesismission.jpl.nasa.gov/educate/scimodule/Cosmogony/CosmogonyPDF/CosCosmolTT.pdf NASA education]&lt;/ref&gt; Another definition of cosmology is &quot;the study of the universe, and humanity's place in it&quot;.&lt;ref name=bs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/|title=Christianity: beliefs about creation and evolution|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern cosmology is dominated by the [[Big Bang]] theory, which brings together observational astronomy and [[particle physics]].&lt;ref&gt;http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cosmology&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though the word ''cosmology'' is recent (first used in 1730 in [[Christian Wolff]]'s ''Cosmologia Generalis''), the study of the universe has a long history.

==History==
Until recently, people thought that the [[universe]] was the [[Milky Way]]. They thought this because they could only see the planets up to [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]] and [[star]]s. With the invention of the [[telescope]], our universe got bigger. Even in the 20th century, people thought that the Milky Way was the universe. With the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], people could see things far away.

[[File:Brazil.Brasilia.01.jpg|thumb|[[Brasilia]] Cathedral]]
A '''church''' is a [[building]] that was constructed to allow people to meet to [[worship]] together. These people are usually [[Christianity|Christians]], or influenced by Christianity. Some other religious groups also call their religious buildings churches.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: 2006 - Page 252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to the Unitarian and Universalist Traditions - Page 128, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the number of people that are in a community, the churches come in different sizes. Small churches are called [[chapel]]s. The churches in a particular geographical area form a group called the [[diocese]].  Each diocese has a [[cathedral]].  In most cases, the cathedral is a very big church. Cathedrals are the seat of [[bishop]]s.

[[File:Madeleine Paris.jpg|thumb|[[La Madeleine, Paris]] is one of the main sights in [[Paris, France]]]]

In the [[Early Christianity|early days of Christianity]] people had to worship in secret. Christian worship was not allowed in the [[Roman empire]], so Christians had to meet in a secret place. Sometimes they met in people’s houses or barns, sometimes they met underground. The first places that were built for Christian worship were small chapels that were cut into a rock where people could worship without being discovered.

After the death of the Roman emperor [[Constantine I (Rome)|Constantine]] in [[337]] A.D. Christians were allowed to have buildings to worship in. These first churches were built on a similar plan to Roman [[basilica]]s. This plan was later used for the fine [[Gothic]] cathedrals and churches that were built at the end of the [[Middle Ages]].

There are several parts in the architecture of a church. Not all churches will have all these parts:

* The '''[[nave]]''' is the main part of the church where the congregation (the people who come to worship) sit. 
* The '''aisles''' (rhymes with “piles”) are the sides of the church which may run along the side of the nave.
* The '''transept''', if there is one, is an area which crosses the nave near the top of the church. This makes the church shaped like a cross, which is a symbol of the belief that [[Jesus]] died on the [[crucifix|cross]].
* The '''chancel''' leads up to the [[altar]] at the top of the church. The altar is in the '''sanctuary'''. The word “[[sanctuary]]” means “sacred place”. People were not allowed to be [[arrest]]ed in the sanctuary, so they were safe. The altar is usually at the [[east]] end of the church. People in the church sit facing the altar. We say that the church “faces east”.
* Churches will also have a '''tower''' or [[steeple]], usually at the west end. If the church has a transept the tower may be above the centre of the transept.

In Roman Catholic churches there is always a stoup (bowl) of [[holy water]] near the entrance of the church. This tradition comes from the fact that Roman [[basilica]]s had a fountain for washing in front of the entrance. The [[font]] is a bowl where people (often babies) are [[baptism|baptized]]. This is also near the entrance of the church. This is a symbol of the fact that it is welcoming the people into the Christian church.

Traditionally the nave has long [[bench]]es for the congregation to sit on. These are called '''pews'''. Some churches may now have replaced their pews with chairs so that they can be moved about for different occasions. At the front of the nave is the '''pulpit''' where the priest [[preach]]es (these talks are called “[[sermon]]s”). There is also a [[lectern]] (like a large [[music stand]]) from where the lessons (the [[Bible]] readings) are read.

If there are aisles along the side of the nave there will be [[column|pillars]] which hold up the roof. In large churches or cathedrals there may be a row of little arches along the top of these pillars. This is called the '''triforium'''. Over the triforium is the '''clerestory''' which is a row of small windows high up in the church wall.

The chancel is the most holy part of the church, and this is why it is often separated from the nave by a screen which can be made of wood or stone, or occasionally iron. The congregation can see through the screen. On the top of the screen there may be a cross. This is called a rood (pronounce like “rude”) screen. Priests used to climb up a staircase to the top of the rood screen to read the [[epistle]] and the [[gospel]]. Sometimes people sang from there.

Inside the chancel are the benches where the [[Choir (music)|choir]] sit. These are called '''choir stalls'''. They are on both sides. The two sides of the choir sit facing one another. The choir members who sit on the left (north side) are called “cantoris” (the side where the “[[Cantor (church)|cantor]]” sits) and those on the right (south side) are called “decani” (the side where the [[deacon]] sits). In some large churches or cathedrals the seats for the priests tip up. The top of these seats, when they are tipped up, are called '''misericords''' (from the Latin word for “mercy”). This is because the priests or monks were able to lean against them when they got tired if they had to stand up for a long time.

Sometimes there are holes in the walls of the screen so that the congregation can see through. These are called '''squints'''. If there is a recess in the wall it is called an '''aumbry'''. It is a cupboard for [[Eucharist|communion]] [[wine]] that has been blessed by a priest.

The altar may be right at the east end of the church, but in larger churches or cathedrals it is often much farther forward. In that case the very east end is called an '''apse'''. Sometimes it is a separate chapel called the “Lady Chapel”.

== Churches through the ages ==

The design of churches changed a lot during the course of history. Often churches were made bigger. When this happened there may be a mixture of architectural styles. These styles vary a lot in different countries.

=== English churches ===

In [[England|English]] churches there were several different periods of architecture:

* The [[Saxon architecture|Saxon]] period ([[7th century|700]]-[[1050]]) was a time when churches were very simple. The end of the church (end of the sanctuary) was often rounded. Hardly any are left now because they were mostly made of [[wood]].
* The [[Norman architecture|Norman]] period ([[1050]]-[[1190]]) came from the style called [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] which was popular in Europe. The arches had ornaments which were called “mouldings”. The tops of the pillars looked like [[cushion]]s, so they were called “cushion capitals”. The windows were narrow and rounded at the top.
* [[Early English architecture|Early English]] or [[Gothic architecture]] ([[1190]]-[[1280]]) was not as solid and heavy as Norman architecture. Towers were elegant and tall, like the tower of [[Salisbury Cathedral]].
* The [[Decorated architecture|Decorated]] style of architecture ([[1280]]-[[1360]])was popular at a time when the [[plague]] (Black Death) was raging and a third of the people in England died. For that reason, not so much building was done then. There were lots of stone carvings were made in churches at that time.
* The [[Perpendicular architecture|Perpendicular]] style ([[1360]]-[[1540]]) was very grand. It had lots of straight upward lines and [[fan vaulting]]. This can be seen in [[Westminster Abbey]] and [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]]. Many churches that can be seen in England were built in this period.

In the 1600s, churches were built in a variety of styles. Often they copied some of the older styles. After the [[Great Fire of London]] many new churches were built by the architect Sir [[Christopher Wren]]. They were built in the classical style. Churches continued to be built in later centuries like this, but also the Gothic style continued to be used.

Modern churches often do not have the traditional cross-shape. It is difficult for the congregation to see and hear what is happening in the chancel. Modern churches bring the congregation, choir and priests in closer touch. An example is the round design for the [[Church of Christ the Cornerstone, Milton Keynes|Church of Christ the Cornerstone]] in [[Milton Keynes]]. Modern churches are often simpler but with a warmer character than the Gothic churches. Many have beautiful [[mosaic]] glass windows. [[Coventry Cathedral]] is a famous example of a modern church building.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Piazza del Campo (Siena).jpg|thumb|250px|The medieval city of [[Sienna]] with its town square and magnificent [[town hall]]. A modern [[suburb]] can be seen in the background.]]

A '''city''' {{Audio|En-uk-city.ogg|pronunciation}}) is a place where many people [[wikt:live|live]] together. A city has many [[building]]s and [[street]]s. It has houses or apartments for many people to live, shops where they may buy things, places para people to work and a [[government]] [[organisation]] to run the city, and to keep [[law]] and [[wikt:order|order]] in the city. Many people live in cities because it is easy for them to find and do the things they want there. A city usually has a &quot;city centre&quot; where government and [[business]] take place, and places called [[suburb]]s where people live around the outside of the centre.

==Definition==
[[Image:Hobart Marina MTWellington.jpg|thumb|250px|Hobart, a small city in [[Australia]]]]
There is no rule that is used all over the world to decide why some places are called &quot;city&quot; and other places are called &quot;town&quot;. 

Some things that make a city are: 
* A long history.
* A large [[population]]. 
* A centre where business and [[local government]] takes place.
* Special powers called [[town privileges]] which have been given by the government of the [[country]], or its ruler. This was done especially during the [[Middle Ages]]. 
* Having a cathedral or a [[university]]. This rule is found in the United Kingdom. The smallest &quot;cathedral cities&quot; are St. David's and St Asaph's which are both in [[Wales]], and Ripon and Wells which are in England.
 
In American English, people often call all places cities.&lt;ref&gt;In the USA, on forms (papers asking for information), the word &quot;City&quot; is generally used for the place where a person lives, even if the person who wants to write in the form might live in a city, a town, or a [[village]] or hamlet (a very small village).&lt;/ref&gt; (See below: Size of cities)

==Size of cities== 
[[Image:004SFEC LONDON-200705.JPG|thumb|250px|The River Thames is part of London's transport system. This picture shows the &quot;City of London&quot;.]] 
[[image:Skyscrapers of Shinjuku 2009 January.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Tokyo]], is the world's most populous metropolitan area.]]
The sizes of cities can be very different. This depends on the type of city that it is. Cities that were built hundreds of years ago and which have not changed much, are very much smaller than modern cities. There are two main reasons. One reason is that old cities often have a city wall, and most of the city is inside it. Another important reason is that the streets in old cities are often narrow. If the city got too big, it was hard for a cart carrying food to get to the [[market place]]. People in cities need food, and the food always has to come from outside the city. Cities that were on a river like [[London]] could grow much bigger than cities that were on a mountain like [[Sienna]] in [[Italy]], because the river made a [[transport]] route for carrying food and other [[goods]], as well as for transporting people. London has been changing continually for hundreds of years, while Siena, which was a very important city in the 1300s has changed very little in 700 years. Modern cities with modern transport systems can grow very large, because the streets are wide enough for cars, buses and trucks, and there are often railway lines as well.

In the US, the word city is often used for towns that are not very big. When the first European people went to America, they gave the name &quot;city&quot; to new places. They hoped the places would be great cities in the future. For example, Salt Lake City was the name given to a village of 148 people. When they started building the town they made street plans and called it Great Salt Lake City (for the nearby Great Salt Lake). Now, 150 years later, it really is a big city. 

In modern times many cities have grown bigger and bigger. The whole area is often called a ''&quot;[[metropolis]]&quot;'' and can sometimes includes several small ancient towns and villages. The ''metropolis'' of London includes the City of London, the City of Westminster and many old villages such as Notting Hill, Southwark, Richmond, Greenwich and etc. The part that is officially known as the &quot;City of London&quot; only takes up one square mile. The rest is known as &quot;Greater London&quot;. Many other cities have grown in the same way. 

These giant cities can be exciting places to live, and many people can find good jobs there, but modern cities also have many problems. Many people cannot find jobs in the cities and have to get [[money]] by [[beggar|begging]] or by [[crime]]. [[Car]]s, factories, and [[garbage|waste]] create a lot of [[pollution]] that makes people sick.

==Urban history== 
[[Image:Carcassonne-vignes.jpg|thumb|250px|Carcassonne is an ancient city in [[France]].]] 

[[Urban]] History is history of [[civilization]]. The first cities were made in ancient times, as soon as people began to create [[civilization]]. Famous ancient cities which fell to [[ruins]] included [[Babylon]], [[Troy]], [[Mycenae]] and Mohenjo Daro.

[[Benares]] in northern [[India]] is one among the ancient cities which has a history of more 3000 years. Other cities that have existed since ancient times are [[Athens]] in [[Greece]], [[Rome]] and [[Volterra]] in [[Italy]], [[Alexandria]] in [[Egypt]] and [[York]] in England.

In [[Europe]], in the [[Middle Ages]], being a city was a special [[wikt:privilege|privilege]], granted by [[nobility]]. Cities that fall into this category, usually had (or still have) city walls. The people who lived in the city were privileged over those who did not. Medieval cities that still have walls include [[Carcassonne]] in [[France]], [[Tehran]] in [[Iran]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] in [[Spain]] and [[Canterbury]] in [[England]]. 

In the [[United Kingdom]], a city is a town which people have always called a city, or which has got the name &quot;city&quot; status by royal charter (a special paper from the king or queen). Cities usually get this because they have a special number of people or are important. In the past, cities got that name if they had a cathedral or a university. Some cathedral cities, for example St David's, are small, and people do not normally think of them as cities. Cities that became cities because of their university generally grow because more people move there to be educated at the university colleges. The university cities of [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]] are famous throughout the world. 

==World's largest cities==
[[Image:Rocinha Favela.jpg|thumb|250px|In [[Rio de Janeiro]], a city famous for its beauty, large slums lie between the richest districts. Many of the world's large cities have areas of [[poverty]] like this.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Bakken.jpg|thumb|Cooking food on a stove.]]
'''Cooking''' is a process to make [[food]] ready to eat by [[heat]]ing it. People can cook food with [[fire]] using [[wood]] or [[charcoal]], with a [[stove]] that uses [[propane]] or [[natural gas]], or with a stove that uses [[electricity]]. An [[oven]] is a part of a stove that is like a [[box]]. People also build ovens out of [[clay]] or [[brick]]s.

There are several different ways to cook food. We [[Boiling|boil]] food by cooking it in water. We [[Frying|fry]] food by cooking it in hot [[butter]], [[fat]] or [[oil]]. We [[Baking|bake]] food by keeping it hot in an [[oven]]. 
We [[roast]] or [[grill]] food by holding it over a hot fire.

People often cook [[meat]] by boiling, roasting or grilling it. People bake [[bread]]. Some breads are [[Frying|fried]].

Usually we cook the food in some kind of [[pot]] or [[frying pan|pan]].  Sometimes people cook food by putting it directly into the fire, by wrapping the food in [[leaves]] before they put it into the fire, or holding it over a fire with a [[stick]].

Before foods are cooked, we say they are [[raw]]. Some foods are good to eat raw.  Other foods are not good for the body when they are raw, so they must be cooked. Some foods are good to eat either raw or cooked and can be used in different recipes.

[[Image:Cooks 050918 154402.jpg|thumb|Cooks at work.]]
A person whose job it is to cook food may be called a '''cook''' or a '''chef'''.  However, the word '''cooker''' means a [[machine]] or [[tool]] that a cook might use to cook food, such as a ''[[rice]] cooker.''

To many people, cooking is an art. To many other people, it is a job.
Cooking as an [[art]] is [[preparing]] the food so it tastes and looks really good.

==Economy==

There is a large [[economy]] for cooking in the world. [[Restaurant]]s [[hire]] skilled cooks for amounts of [[money]] and [[customer]]s pay for [[meal]]s.

A '''crime''' (or '''misdemeanor''' or '''felony''') is an act done by a [[person]] which is against the [[law]]s of a [[country]] or region. A person who does this is called a '''criminal'''.

The basic idea of what things are called &quot;crimes&quot; is that they are thought to be things that might cause a problem for another person. Things like [[kill]]ing another person, [[injury|injuring]] another person, or [[steal]]ing from another person are crimes in most countries. Also, it can be a crime to eat some types of food, such as meat of rare exotic animals, [[marijuana]] leaves, or [[mushroom]]s that contain [[psychedelic]] drugs.

When some criminals make money from crime, they try to stop the [[police]] finding out where the money came from by [[money laundering]].

== Levels of crime ==
There are various levels of crimes:
* '''misdemeanor''' - is a minor crime, typically punished by a fee or less than 1 year in [[jail]].
* '''felony''' (or '''high crime''') - is a major crime, typically punished by 1 year or longer in [[prison]].

Different countries have many different ideas of what things are crimes, and which are severe enough to be treated as felonies. Some things that are crimes in one country are not crimes in other countries. Many countries get their ideas of what things are crimes from [[religion]]s or controversial events which cause a law to be quickly created. For example, a religion might consider eating a particular food to be a crime. Another example is the new ban in some regions on [[texting]] while driving an [[automobile]], which was created after people died in wrecks when they were distracted by [[mobile phone]] messages.

In many countries, if people say they made or wrote a [[book]], [[movie]], [[song]], or [[Web page]] that they did not really make or write, it is a crime against [[copyright]] laws. In many countries, helping to grow, make, move, or sell [[illegal drug]]s is a crime. 

In most countries, [[police]] try to stop crimes and to find criminals. When the police find someone who they think might be a criminal, they usually hold the person in a [[jail]]. Then, usually, a [[court]] or a [[judge]] decides if the person really did a crime. If the court or judge decides that the person really did it, then he or she might have to pay a [[fine]] or go to [[prison]]. Sometimes the judge might decide that the criminal should be [[execute]]d (killed). This is called [[Capital punishment]] (or the ''Death Penalty''). There are countries in the world who execute criminals, and others who do not.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Time Cube''' is a [[website]] created by [[Gene Ray]]. On that website, Dr. Ray explains his &quot;Time Cube&quot; theory, which describes the planet [[Earth]] as having a [[cube|cubic]] [[symmetry]], and [[time]] as rotating four &quot;corners&quot;. He also says that all of modern [[physics]] is wrong. Many scientists reject these ideas, saying that they make no sense and cannot be [[test]]ed.

The Time Cube website is written in an angry and hateful voice. On his site, Ray says that anyone who does not believe in Time Cube is &quot;stupid and evil&quot;. Some of the comments are [[racism|racist]], especially against black people and [[Judaism|Jews]]. There are also many comments against [[homosexuality|gay]] people. Many people find the site to be difficult to understand. 

Ray has spoken about Time Cube at two universities in the [[United States]], MIT and Georgia Tech. At MIT, a professor tried to cancel the lecture before it took place. Ray believes this is proof of a [[conspiracy]] to keep information about Time Cube hidden.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Census of Marine Life''' is a ten year survey of [[life]] in the [[ocean]]s, starting in [[2000]]. Its head is [[Ron O'Dor]] of [[Dalhousie University]] in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], Canada. It uses data from researchers all over the world. More than 70 [[nation]]s are involved and over a [[billion]] [[United States dollar|US dollars]] will be spent on it. 

It is a major work of [[marine ecology]].

It is trying to do what the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) and [[National Geographic Society]] did for [[terrestrial ecoregion]]s - say exactly what is alive on the planet.

In this case, in the seas.

'''Maize''' (called '''corn''' in some countries) is a member of the [[grass]] [[family (biology)|family]] ''Poaceae''. It is a cereal [[grain]] that was first grown by people in ancient [[Central America]]. It is now the third most important cereal crop in the world. 

Maize is a leafy stalk whose kernels have seeds inside. It is an [[angiosperm]], which means that its seeds are enclosed inside a fruit or shell. It is used as a [[food]] staple by many people in [[Mexico]], Central and [[South America]] and parts of [[Africa]]. In [[Europe]] and the rest of [[North America]], maize is grown mostly for use as [[animal]] feed. In [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], maize is commonly referred to as &quot;corn&quot;. In recent years corn has become an important part in a majority of American foods through the use of [[corn starch]]. 

Maize has been a fruitful [[model organism]] for [[genetic]] research over many years: see [[Barbara McClintock]]. Research has shown that [[artificial selection]] developed maize from a Mexican plant called

'''Calculus''' is a branch of [[mathematics]] which helps us understand changes between values that are related by a [[Function (mathematics)|function]]. For example, if you had one formula telling how much money you got every day, calculus would help you understand related formulas like how much money you have in total, and whether you are getting more money or less than you used to.   All these formulas are  [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of time, and so that is one way to think of calculus -- studying functions of time. There are two different types of calculus. '''Differential calculus''' divides things into small (''different'') pieces and tells us how they change from one moment to the next, while '''integral calculus''' joins (''integrates'') the small pieces together and tells us how much of something is made, overall, by a series of changes. Calculus is used in many different areas of study such as [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[biology]], [[engineering]], [[economics]], [[medicine]] and [[sociology]].

The word '''Calculus''' comes from the [[Latin language]] meaning &quot;small stone&quot;.

==History==
In the 1670s and 1680s, Sir [[Isaac Newton]] in England and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in Germany figured out calculus at the same time, working separately from each other. Newton wanted to have a new way to predict where to see [[planet]]s in the sky, because [[astronomy]] had always been a popular and useful form of science, and knowing more about the motions of the objects in the night sky was important for [[navigation]] of ships. Leibniz wanted to measure the space (area) under a [[curve]] (a line which is not straight). Many years later, the two men argued over who discovered it first. Scientists from England supported Newton, but scientists from the rest of Europe supported Leibniz. Most [[mathematician]]s today agree that both men share the credit equally. Some parts of modern calculus come from Newton, such as its uses in [[physics]]. Other parts come from Leibniz, such as the symbols used to write it.

They were not the first people to use mathematics to describe the physical world—[[Aristotle]] and [[Pythagoras]] came earlier, and so did [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], who said that mathematics was the language of science. But they were the first to design a system that describes how things change over time and can predict how they will change in the future.

The name &quot;calculus&quot; was the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for a small stone the ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s used in counting and [[gambling]]. The English word &quot;calculate&quot; comes from the same Latin word.

==Differential calculus==
{{main|Differential calculus}}   

'''Differential calculus''' is the process of finding out the rate of change of a [[variable]] compared to another variable. It can be used to find the speed of a moving object or the slope of a curve, figure out the maximum or minimum points of a curve, or find answers to problems in the [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] areas of physics, among many other uses.

Many amounts can be variables, which can change their value unlike numbers such as 5 or 200. Some examples of variables are [[distance]] and [[time]]. The [[speed]] of an object is how far it travels in a particular time. So if a town is 80 kilometres (50 miles) away and a person in a car gets there in one hour, they have traveled at an average speed of 80 kilometres (50 miles) per hour. But this is only an [[average]]—they may have been traveling faster at some times (on a highway) and slower at others (at a traffic light or on a small street where people live). Imagine a driver trying to figure out a car's speed using only its odometer (distance meter) and clock, without a speedometer!

Until calculus was invented, the only way to work this out was to cut the time into smaller and smaller pieces, so the average speed over the smaller time would get closer and closer to the actual speed at a point in time. This was a very long and hard process and had to be done each time people wanted to work something out.

[[File:Simple curve showing tangents.svg|thumb|right|On a curve, two different points have different slopes. The red and blue lines are [[Trigonometric function|tangent]]s to the curve.]]

A very similar problem is to find the [[wikt:slope|slope]] (how steep it is) at any point on a [[curve]]. The slope of a ''[[straight]]'' line is easy to work out—it is simply how much it goes up (''y'' or [[wikt:vertical|vertical]]) divided by how much it goes across (''x'' or [[wikt:horizontal|horizontal]]). On a ''curve'', though, the slope is a variable (has different values at different points) because the line bends. But if the curve was to be cut into very, very small pieces, the curve at the point would look almost like a very short straight line. So to work out its slope, a straight line can be drawn through the point with the same slope as the curve at that point. If it is done exactly right, the straight line will have the same slope as the curve, and is called a [[Trigonometric function|tangent]]. But there is no way to know (without very complicated mathematics) whether the tangent is exactly right, and our eyes are not accurate enough to be certain whether it is exact or simply very close.

What Newton and Leibniz found was a way to work out the slope (or the speed in the distance example) exactly using simple and logical rules. They divided the curve into an [[infinity|infinite]] number of very small pieces. They then chose points on either side of the range they were interested in and worked out tangents at each. As the points moved closer together towards the point they were interested in, the slope ''approached'' a particular value as the tangents approached the real slope of the curve. They said that this particular value it approached was the actual slope.

[[File:First principles differentiation demo.svg|thumb|220px|A picture that shows what ''x'' and ''x + h'' mean on the curve.]]

Let's say we have a function ''y'' = f(''x''). f is short for [[function (mathematics)|function]], so this equation means &quot;y is a function of x&quot;. This tells us that how high y is on the [[vertical]] axis depends on what x (the [[horizontal]] axis) is at that time. For example with the equation ''y'' = ''x''², we know that if ''x'' is 1, then ''y'' will be 1; if ''x'' is 3, then ''y'' will be 9; if ''x'' is 20, then ''y'' will be 400.

&lt;math&gt;\lim_{h\rightarrow0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

If we use y = x², the '''derivative''' produced [[Differential calculus#How_it_works|using this method]] is 2''x'', or 2 multiplied by ''x''. So we know without having to draw any tangent lines that at any point on the curve ''f(x)'' = ''x''², the '''derivative''' ''f'(x)'' (marked with an [[apostrophe]]) will be 2''x'' at any point. This process of working out a slope using limits is called '''differentiation''', or finding the derivative.

Leibniz came to the same result, but called h &quot;dx&quot;, which means &quot;a tiny amount of x&quot;. He called the resulting change in f(x) &quot;dy&quot;, which means &quot;a tiny amount of y&quot;. Leibniz's notation is used by more books because it is easy to understand when the equations become more complicated. In Leibniz notation:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x)&lt;/math&gt;

Mathematicians have grown this basic theory to make simple [[algebra]] rules which can be used to find the derivative of almost any function.

==Main idea of calculus==
The main idea in calculus is called the &quot;Fundamental Theorem of Calculus&quot;. This main idea says that the two calculus processes, differential and integral calculus, are opposites. That is, a person can use differential calculus to undo an integral calculus process. Also, a person can use integral calculus to undo a differential calculus method. This is just like using division to &quot;undo&quot; multiplication, or addition to &quot;undo&quot; subtraction.

In a single sentence, the Fundamental Theorem runs something like this: &quot;The derivative of the integral of a function ''f'' is the function itself&quot;.

==Demonstration of main idea of calculus==
===How to use integral calculus to find areas===
The method integral calculus uses to find areas of shapes is to break the shape up into many small boxes, and add up the area of each of the boxes. This gives an approximation to the area.  If the boxes are made narrower and narrower, then there are more and more of them, and the area of all the boxes becomes very close to the area of the shape.  One of the main ideas of calculus is that we can imagine having an infinite number of these boxes, each infinitely narrow, and then we would have the exact area of the shape.

==Other uses of calculus==
Calculus is used to describe things that [[wikt:change|change]], like things in [[nature]]. It can be used for showing and learning all of these:

*How [[wave (physics)|wave]]s move. Waves are very important in the [[natural]] world. For example, [[sound]] and [[light]] can be thought of as waves.
*Where [[heat]] moves, like in a house. This is useful for [[architecture]] (building houses), so that the house can be as cheap to heat as possible.
*How very small things like [[atoms]] [[act]].
*How fast something will [[falling|fall]], also known as [[gravity]].
*How [[machine|machines]] work, also known as [[mechanics]].
*The [[orbit|path]] of the [[moon]] as it moves around the [[earth]]. Also, the path of the earth as it moves around the [[sun]], and any [[planet]] or [[moon]] moving around anything in [[Outer space|space]].

A '''coin''' is normally a [[round]] piece of [[metal]] that is used as [[currency]], or money. Coins have been made for about 2600 years; the first place to make coins was Lydia (modern [[Turkey]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.stateuniversity.com/pages/13993/Lydia.html|title=Lydia|accessdate=2009-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
Many coins have unique or complicated [[decorations]]; one side often has the picture of a famous or important person's [[head]] on it. Most people use coins as [[currency]]. 

=== Uses ===
The different decorations on each side of a coin might be used to decide things [[random]]ly. This is called &quot;tossing a coin&quot;.  A person can throw the coin into the air and catch it.  You then look at which side is facing up. If the head is facing up it is called &quot;heads&quot;, if the other side is facing up it is called &quot;tails&quot;. Before tossing the coin someone has to decide what each side means. 

==== Gambling ====
Tossing a coin can be a type of [[gambling]], which is [[illegal]] (against the law) in some [[country|countries]]. However, it is fine if something is gambled upon without a price someone risks. If it's merely to decide something, that is alright. Coins can be used to buy many things, and are often used for buying things such as apples, toothbrushes, and many others. Coins aren't as efficient as money bills, but are still used.

== Other views ==
Some people see coins as a sign of greed, such as some [[Communist]]s and [[Puritan]]s, who sometimes condemn over-hoarding of coins, and [[ascetic]]s, who often keep little in the ways of [[money]] (coins), leading a &quot;poor&quot;-lifestyle.

== Collecting ==
{{main|Coin collecting}}
Because coins have been made for a very long time, some people collect old coins. They can be much cheaper than other old things, especially if they are made of cheap metals like [[copper]]. Older coins normally cost more than newer ones, but rarity matters more-some coins from the 1920s cost vast sums, while some Roman coins cost very little.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''conceptual metaphor''' or '''cognitive metaphor''' is a [[metaphor]] which refers to one domain (group of ideas) in terms of another. For example, treating [[quantity]] in terms of [[direction]]:
#''Prices are rising''.
#''I attacked every weak point in his argument''. (Argument as war rather than enquiry or search for truth).
#''Life is a journey''.
#''Love'' talked about as if it were ''war'' or ''competition''.
#''Time'' talked about as if it were a ''path through space'', or a ''quantity'' that can be saved or spent or wasted.

The idea of a conceptual metaphor came from a book by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in 1980: ''Metaphors we live by''.
:&quot;The most recent linguistic approach to literature is that of cognitive metaphor, which claims that metaphor is not a mode of language, but a mode of thought&quot;. Donald Freeman.

== Political metaphors ==
* '''eminence grise''': literally, &quot;grey man,&quot; from French. Colloquially, the power-behind-the-throne. An official close to the president or monarch who has so much power behind the scenes that he or she may double or serve as the monarch.
* '''figurehead''': a leader whose powers are entirely symbolic, such as a [[constitutional monarch]].
* '''puppet government''': a government that is manipulated by a foreign power for its own interests.
* '''star chamber''': a secretive council or other group within a government that possesses the actual power, regardless of the government's overt form.
* '''character assassination''': spreading (usually) manufactured stories about a candidate with the intent to destroy his or her reputation in the eyes of the public.
* '''landslide victory''': a huge victory for one side.
* '''riding coattails''': victories by local or state politicians because of the popularity of more powerful politicians.
* '''grassroots''': a political movement driven by the constituents of a community.
* '''astroturfing''': formal public relations campaigns in politics and advertising that seek to create the impression of being spontaneous, grassroots behavior.
* '''[[straw man]]''': the practice of refuting an argument that is weaker than one's opponent actually offers, or which he simply has not put forth at all. A type of logical fallacy.
* '''Spin''' (public relations): a heavily biased portrayal of an event or situation.
* '''[[witch-hunt]]''': a hysterical pursuit of political enemies
* '''bread and circuses''': satisfaction of shallow or immediate desires of the populace at the expense of good policy; also, the erosion of civic duty and the public life in a populace.

There are many more, enough to prove the importance of the metaphor in our lives.

'''Comedy''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: Kωμωδία) may be used in different ways:
*A comedy is, in modern times, a [[drama]] which has a generally [[funny]] content and in general a happy ending. This definition is used for [[theatre]] [[Play (theatre)|plays]], and was first used in [[Ancient Greek theatre|Ancient Greece]]. 
*The word comedy is also used for [[television]] shows or [[movie]]s that are funny, silly or that make people [[laughter|laugh]]. 
Comedies may also show people telling jokes and funny stories. People who are known for acting in comedies are [[comedian]]s or comedic actors.

== History ==
=== Satire ===
The ancient Greeks had comedies, which were presented in [[competition]]s at the [[festival]] of [[Dionysus|Dionysia]]. 

One of the best-known comedy authors of the time was [[Aristophanes]] (about 446{{ndash}}386 BC). One of his works, ''[[The Clouds]]'' was performed 425 BC. The work did not survive completely, but a later version did survive. It is a satire against [[Socrates]], and pictures the great philosopher as a swaggering con artist. Some of the accusations were re-used at Socrates' [[trial]], twenty years later.  

Typical for satire are that the author criticizes society, and living people. 

=== Satyr plays ===
Another type of Ancient Greek theatre was the [[satyr play]]. This was mock [[drunkenness]], brazen [[sexuality]] (including [[Phallus|phallic]] props), pranks, sight gags, and general merriment. The modern equivalent would be knock-about comedy.

=== Humour ===
Humour, or 'New Comedy' is not about criticizing people or ideas, but rather about showing characters in funny situations. The most important Greek playwright of this type was probably [[Menander]]. The best known [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] comedy writer was [[Plautus]]. He often used Greek comedies for his plays.

Many comedy plays were written in the 1500s by the British writer [[William Shakespeare]].
Shakespeare's comedy plays include:'' [[All’s Well That Ends Well]], [[The Comedy of Errors]], [[A Midsummer Nights Dream]]'', and ''[[Twelfth Night]]''. In Shakespeare's day a comedy did not mean a play that would make people laugh or that had a lot of jokes. Instead it was a play in which all the problems work out all right in the end. This was unlike a tragedy, where the problems do not work out, usually resulting in someone's death.
The two masks, one was smiling, the other crying, often associated with theatre represent comedy and tragedy.

== Types ==
=== Slapstick ===
There are different types of comedy. One type of comedy is called &quot;slap stick comedy.&quot; In &quot;slap stick comedy,&quot; people do silly things such as tripping, falling over or embarrassing themselves just to make people laugh. Slap stick comedy can be used in comedy movies or comedy television shows.

Slap stick comedy was used a lot in [[silent movies|silent (no sound) movies]] from the 1920s. A comedian who acted in the silent movies who used a lot of slapstick comedy was [[Charlie Chaplin]]. In the 1950s and 1960s, comedian [[Jerry Lewis]] also used silly slap stick comedy in his comedy movies.

=== Comedy movies ===
A comedy is a very popular type of movie. Some comedy movies have &quot;slapstick comedy,&quot; in which people just do silly things such as tripping, falling over or embarrassing themselves just to make people laugh. Other comedy movies show funny stories or situations in which people are behaving in a silly manner. Some comedies make the audience laugh by showing strange or unusual images or situations that do not make sense.


=== Parody/spoof ===
A parody or spoof movie makes another movie, series or person look silly to make people laugh.
Imitating and exaggerating one movie in a funny manner to make people laugh 


==== Different types of comedy movies ====
Some types of comedy movies mix comedy with other types of movies. 
*There is a type of movie called a '''[[dramedy]]''', which is a mix of a drama movie and a comedy movie. 
*There is also a type of movie called a '''[[romantic comedy]]''' (sometimes called a &quot;rom-com&quot;). In romantic comedies, there is a love story about a couple who fall in love, along with silly or funny comedy parts.

=== Comedy television shows ===
Comedy shows are very popular on [[television]]. Comedy shows on television are often called &quot;[[situational comedies|sitcoms]].&quot; The word &quot;sitcom&quot; is a shortened way of saying &quot;situational comedy.&quot; Television situational comedies usually show characters who do silly or funny things which make the audience laugh.

[[File:CometDiagram.png|thumb|205px|Diagram of a comet's [[orbit]]]]
A '''comet''' is a [[ball]] of mostly [[ice]] that moves around in [[outer space]]. Comets are often described as &quot;dirty snowballs&quot;.  They are very different from [[asteroid]]s.  The [[orbital inclination]]s of comets are usually high and not near the [[ecliptic]] where most [[solar system]] objects are found. Most of them are long-period comets and go further than [[Pluto (planet)|Pluto]]. Those are very far away from the Sun, but some comets come near enough to Earth for us to see at [[wikt:night|night]].  

They have long &quot;tails&quot;, because the Sun [[melt]]s the ice. A comet's tail does not trail behind it, but points directly away from the Sun, because it is blown by the [[solar wind]].
The hard [[centre]] of the comet is the ''[[comet nucleus|nucleus]]''. It is one of the blackest things in the solar system. When [[light]] shone on the nucleus of [[Halley's Comet]], the comet reflected only 4% of the light back to us.

[[Periodic comets|''Periodic'' comets]] visit again and again. ''Non-periodic'' or ''single-apparition'' comets visit only once.

Comets sometimes break up, as [[Comet Biela]] did in the 19th century.  [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] broke up, and the pieces hit [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]] in [[1994]]. Some comets orbit (go around) together in groups. [[Astronomer]]s think these comets are broken pieces that used to be one object.

== History of comets ==
In old times, people used to be scared of comets. They did not know what they were, or where they came from. Some thought that they were fireballs sent from demons or gods to destroy the earth. They said that each time a comet appeared, it would bring bad luck with it. Whenever a comet appeared, a king would die. For example, the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] shows the return of [[Halley's Comet]] and the death of a king. Comets were also known to end wars and thought to bring famine.  During the [[Renaissance]], [[astronomer]]s started to look at comets with less superstition and to base their [[science]] on observations. [[Tycho Brahe]] reasoned that comets did not come from the earth, and his calculations showed that comets must be six times farther than the earth is from the moon.

[[Edmond Halley]] reasoned that some comets are periodic, that is, they appear again after a certain number of years, and again and again. This led to the first prediction of a comet's return, [[Halley's Comet]], named after him.

[[Isaac Newton]] also studied comets. He realised that comets make U-turns around the sun. He asked his friend Edmond Halley to publish this in his book ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''. Before Newton said this, people believed that comets go in to the sun, then another comes out from behind the sun. 

In later years some astronomers thought comets were spit out by planets, especially [[Jupiter]].

All this new information and research gave people confidence, but some still thought that comets were messengers from the gods. One 18th century vision said that comets were the places that [[hell]] was, where souls would ride, being burned up by the heat of the sun and frozen by the cold of space.

In modern times [[space probe]]s have visited comets to learn more about them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cytology''' is the study of the [[cell]]s, especially their appearance and [[structure]]. Cells are the small parts that make up all living things, and their effects on each other and their [[environment]].

There are two types of cells. [[Prokaryote|Prokaryotic]] cells do not have a clear and easy-to-see [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], and do not have a [[membrane]], or wall, around them. [[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic]] cells have an easy-to-see nucleus where all of the cell's functions take place, and a membrane around them. The main [[organelle]]s of a cell and their uses are: 
* [[Mitochondria]]: produces [[energy]] for the cell
* [[Endoplasmic reticulum]]: makes [[protein]]s and [[carbohydrate]]s for the cell to use
* [[Golgi body|Golgi bodies]]: store and package products that the cell uses
* Plastid (present in plant cells only): contains chemicals needed to [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]] (create energy from sunlight); in plants only.
* Nucleus: directs the actions of the cell

[[File:Famous Christians around the world.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Set of pictures for a number of famous Christians from various fields]]
A '''Christian''' {{audio|En-us-Christian.ogg}} is a [[Human|person]] who believes in [[Christianity]], a [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] [[religion]]. Christianity is mostly about the [[life]] and [[teach]]ings of [[Jesus Christ]], in the [[New Testament]]&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/ |title=''BBC - Religion &amp; Ethics - Christianity'' |accessdate=2008-07-11 |format= |work=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Interpretation|interpreted]] of [[Prophecy|prophesied]] in the [[Hebrew Bible]]/[[Old Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=29&amp;chapter=53&amp;version=31 |title=''Book of Isaiah, Chapter 53'' |accessdate=2008-07-11 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christianity is the world's largest religion, with 2.1 billion followers around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt; The Quran states that true Christians should love Muslims; &quot;And thou wilt find the nearest of them in affection to those who believe (to be) those who say: Lo! We are Christians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Qur'an, Sura 5 (Al-Ma'ida), ayat 82-85&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians consider the Holy Bible to be a sacred book, inspired by God.  The Holy Bible is a combination of the Hebrew Bible, or Torah, and a collection of writings called the New Testament.  Views on the importance of these writings vary.  Some Christian groups prefer to favor the New Testament, while others believe the entire Bible is equally important.  Also, while many Christians prefer to consider the Bible as true, inspired by God, not all groups believe that it is completely accurate.  Some of these groups may think that the Bible is a collection of stories meant to show who God is, or even just the opinions of humans that reveal some commonly-believed truth.{{fact|date=February 2010}}

The issue of &quot;who is a Christian?&quot; can be very controversial.  Christians often disagree over this issue due to their differences in opinion on spiritual matters. It is not possible to provide a statement that all readers may agree with, therefore, a definition will not be provided.  Even very traditional doctrines such as the belief that Jesus Christ is God, or that God consists of the Father, Son, and Spirit, are not common to people who claim Christianity as their religion. {{fact|date=August 2014}}

Many Christians choose to go to church. Most Christians believe this to be a sign of their religious devotion to God and an act of worship.  However, some Christian groups think that one can be a Christian without ever going to a church.  Though there are many different viewpoints on the issue, most Protestants believe all Christians are part of the spiritual church of Christ, whether or not those Christians go to an actual church each week.  On the other hand, [[Catholic]]s believe that the Holy Catholic Church is the only true church.

[[File:Various cheeses.jpg|thumb|Some different types of cheese]]
'''Cheese''' is milk made into a solid form that you eat. There are many types of cheese. Many things affect the [[style]], [[texture]] and [[flavor]] of a cheese. These include the milk ([[cow]] or [[goat]]), if the milk has been [[Pasteurization|pasteurized]], the amount of [[butterfat]], [[bacteria]] and [[mold]] in the cheese, how the cheese is made and how old the cheese is.

For some cheeses, the milk is [[curd]]led by adding [[acid]]s such as [[vinegar]] or [[lemon]] juice. Most cheeses are acidified by bacteria. This bacteria turns milk [[sugar]]s into [[lactic acid]]. [[Rennet]] is then used to finish the curdling.  [[Vegetarianism|Vegetarian]] alternatives to rennet can also be used. Most of these are made by [[fermentation]] of a [[fungus]] called ''Mucor miehei''. Other alternatives use species of the ''[[Cynara]]'' [[thistle]] [[family (biology)|family]].

== The origin of cheese ==
People have been making cheese since before [[history]] was written down. It is not known when cheese was first made. It is known that cheese was eaten by the [[Sumerians]] in about 4000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenibble.com/REVIEWS/main/cheese/cheese2/history.asp|title=The History Of Cheese: From An Ancient Nomad’s Horseback To Today’s Luxury Cheese Cart |work=The Nibble|publisher=Lifestyle Direct, Inc.|accessdate=2012-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How cheese is made ==

Cheese is made using milk. The milk of [[cow]]s, [[goat]]s, and [[sheep]] are most popular. [[Buffalo]], [[camel]] and even [[Horse|mare]]'s milk can also be used. Cheese makers usually cook the milk in large [[pot]]s. They add [[salt]] and a [[substance]] from the [[stomach]] of young cows called [[rennet]]. This curdles the cheese and makes it solid. Some makers do not add [[rennet]]. They curdle the cheese in other ways. Cheese made in [[factory|factories]] is often curdled by using bacteria. Other [[ingredients]] are added and the cheese is usually aged for a short time.

== Types of cheese ==
There are many different ways to [[classification|classify]] cheeses. Some ways include:
* How long the cheese was aged 
* The [[texture]] of the cheese. These include Hard, Soft and Softer.
* How the cheese was made
* What type of [[milk]] was used to make the cheese. This is mainly what [[animal]] the milk comes from. The [[diet]] of the animal can also affect the type of cheese made from its milk.
* How much [[fat]] is in the cheese
* What color the cheese is

There are also man-made foods that some people use instead of cheese. These are called [[Cheese analogue]]s.

Different types of cheese include:

{{Other uses|constitutions in general|the US Constitution|United States Constitution}}

The '''constitution''' of a [[country]] (or a [[state]]) is a special type of [[law]] [[document]] that tells how its [[government]] is supposed to work. It tells how the country's [[leader]]s are to be chosen and how long they get to stay in [[office]], how new laws are made and old laws are to be changed or removed based on law, what kind of people are allowed to [[vote]] and what other [[rights]] they are guaranteed, and how the constitution can be changed.

Limits are put on the Government in how much power they have within the Constitution ''(see [[Rule of Law]] )''. On the other hand, countries with repressive or corrupt governments frequently do not stick to their constitutions, or have bad constitutions without giving freedom to citizens and others. This can be known as [[dictatorship]] or simply &quot;bending the rules&quot;. A Constitution is often a way of uniting within a [[Federation]].

The [[United Kingdom|UK's]] constitution is not written in one single [[wikt:document|document]] like many other countries' are. In fact, the UK's constitution is not completely written down at all. Some of it can be found in writing, starting with the [[Magna Carta]] of 1215 and the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights Act 1689]] and including more modern [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]]. Other parts of it are considered [[common law]] and are made up of the decisions of [[judge]]s over many hundreds of years in a system called legal or [[Judiciary|judicial]] [[Precedent|precedence]]. Because of this, some people say that the [[United Kingdom]] has a ''[[de facto]]'' or &quot;unwritten&quot; constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnett|first=H.|title=Constitutional and Administrative Law|publisher=Cavendish|location=London|year=2005|edition=5|pages=9|quote=Conversely, &quot;A written constitution is one contained within a single document or a [finite] series of documents, with or without amendments&quot;, ''id''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[United States]] in 1787 began a trend in the writing of constitutions. The [[United States Constitution]] is also the shortest that people are still using, and it has been changed (amended) many times over the years. It was made after the colonists won their independence from Britain. At first they had the [[Articles of Confederation]] but the Articles were replaced with today's Constitution.

The Indian constitution is the longest ever written constitution in the world. It  has 395 Articles and 12 Schedules in it, divided into 22 parts. It has been amended more than 100 times.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Circle - black simple.svg|thumb|A circle]]

A '''circle''' is a [[round]], regular, [[2D|two-dimensional]] shape, shaped like the letter o.

The [[centre]] of a circle is the point in the very middle.

The [[radius]] of a circle is a line from the centre of the circle to a point on the side.  

All [[point (geometry)|point]]s on the edge of the circle are at the same [[distance]] from the centre.  In other words, the radius is the same length all the way around the circle.  Mathematicians use the letter ''r'' for the length of a circle's radius.

The [[diameter]] (meaning &quot;all the way across&quot;) of a circle is a straight line that goes from one side to the opposite and right through the centre of the circle.  Mathematicians use the letter ''d'' for the length of this line.

The diameter of a circle is equal to twice its radius (''d'' equals 2 times ''r'').

:&lt;math&gt;
d = 2\ r 
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[circumference]] (meaning &quot;all the way around&quot;) of a circle is the line that goes around the centre of the circle.  Mathematicians use the letter ''C'' for the length of this line.

The number ''[[pi (mathematical constant)|π]]'' (written as the [[Greek language|Greek]] [[letter]] ''pi'') is a very useful number. It is the length of the circumference divided by the length of the diameter (''π'' equals ''C'' divided by ''d''). As a fraction the number π is equal to about {{frac|22|7}} and as a number it is about 3.14

{|
|-
|||&lt;math&gt;\pi = \frac{C}{d}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\therefore&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;C = 2\pi \, r&lt;/math&gt;
|}
[[File:CircleArea.gif|thumb|right]]
The [[area]], ''a'', inside a circle is equal to the radius multiplied by itself, then multiplied by π (''a'' equals π times ''r'' times ''r'').

:&lt;math&gt;A = \pi \, r^2 &lt;/math&gt;

==Calculating π==
'''π''' can be measured by drawing a large circle, then measuring its diameter (''d'') and circumference (''C''). This is because the circumference of a circle is always π times its diameter.

&lt;math&gt;\pi = \frac{C}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

'''π''' can also be calculated by only using mathematical methods.  Most methods used for calculating the value of π have desirable mathematical properties. However, they are hard to understand without knowing [[trigonometry]] and [[calculus]].  However, some methods are quite simple, such as this form of the [[Gottfried Leibniz|Gregory-Leibniz]] [[series]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \pi = \frac{4}{1}-\frac{4}{3}+\frac{4}{5}-\frac{4}{7}+\frac{4}{9}-\frac{4}{11}\cdots &lt;/math&gt;

While that series is easy to write and calculate, it is not easy to see why it equals π.  An easier to understand approach is to draw an imaginary circle of radius '''r''' centered at the origin.  Then any point (''x'',''y'') whose distance '''d''' from the origin is less than '''r''', calculated by the [[pythagorean theorem]], will be inside the circle:

:&lt;math&gt; d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Finding a set of points inside the circle allows the circle's area '''A''' to be estimated. For example, by using integer coordinates for a big '''r'''. Since the area '''A''' of a circle is π times the radius squared, π can be approximated by using:

:&lt;math&gt; \pi = \frac{A}{r^2} &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Capitalise''' ([[Britain|British]] spelling) or '''capitalize''' ([[North America]]n spelling) means to make one or more [[letter]]s [[Roman alphabet|upper case]].  The first letter of a [[sentence]] is capitalised in many [[language]]s, as are the first letters of [[proper noun]]s such as names of people and places. In [[Germany|German]], however, all nouns are capitalized. It is the only language to do that.

The [[homonym]] '''capitalize''' is a different word, and means &quot;to fully fund as an [[investment]]&quot;.

'''Cuba''' is an island country in the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The country is made up of the big [[island]] of Cuba, the [[Isla de la Juventud]] island, and many [[archipelagos|smaller islands]]. [[Havana]] is the capital of Cuba. It is the largest city. The second largest city is [[Santiago de Cuba]]. In Spanish, the capital is called &quot;La Habana&quot;. Cuba is near the [[United States]], [[Mexico]], [[Haiti]], [[Jamaica]] and the [[Bahamas]]. People from Cuba are called Cubans. The official language is [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Cuba has a warm climate, but has many [[hurricane]]s every year.  

In 1492, [[Christopher Columbus]] landed on the island of Cuba. He claimed it for the [[Kingdom of Spain]]. Cuba became a Spanish colony until the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898. After the war, it was part of the [[United States]]. It gained independence in 1902.

== Culture ==
Cuba is famous for many types of music, especially dance music such as the [[Salsa]] and [[Mambo (rhythm)|Mambo]]. Because Cubans come from Spain, Africa, South America and North America, Cuban music is special and different.

Reading is very popular in Cuba. Many people especially enjoy reading books or things that come from outside the country, even though the government does not approve of this. They also love [[music]] and [[sport]]s. Cuban music is very lively. This is because a lot of it comes from African and Spanish rhythms. [[Baseball]], [[basketball]], and [[Track and field athletics|athletics]] events are loved by many Cuban people. The cuban football-team took at one Football-World-Cup part. In 1938, they reached the quartar-final and lost against [[Sweden]] 0:8.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifepac&quot;/&gt;

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Before Cuba was conquered by the Spaniards, three tribes lived on the island. They were the Taínos, the Ciboneys, and the Guanajatabeyes. The Taínos were the largest and most common of the three tribes. They farmed crops such as beans, corn, squash, and yams. The Taínos also slept in hammocks which the Spaniards would introduce to the rest of the world. Then, in 1492, [[Christopher Columbus]] arrived in Cuba on his first trip to the Americas. Three years later he claimed the islands for the Spanish. The Spanish began to rule Cuba afterwards. The Spanish brought thousands of slaves from Africa to Cuba to work for them. Most of the native Cubans died because of the new diseases brought by the Spanish and Africans. The Spanish also treated the native Cubans very cruelly and massacred many of them. 

The Spanish ruled for many years. Cuba became the most important producer of sugar. In the early 1800's, Cubans rebelled against the Spanish rulers, but failed until 1898, when the United States went to war with the Spanish and defeated them. Cuba became American for four years afterwards, before it became an independent [[republic]] in [[1902]]. Even though Cuba was independent, the Americans still controlled the island by a law called the [[Platt Amendment]]. In 1933 the Cubans stopped the Platt Amendment, but the Americans still had a big say in Cuban politics. Americans owned most of Cuba’s businesses. The Americans supported the leader Fulgencio Batista, who was seen by many Cubans as corrupt.

=== Cuban Revolution ===
In 1959, [[Fidel Castro]] led a revolution against [[Fulgencio Batista]]. Castro took power of Cuba with [[Che Guevara]] from [[Argentina]], his brother Raul, and others who fought against Batista. Castro made many changes to Cuba and ended American ownership of Cuban businesses. This made Castro unpopular in America and the United States banned all contact with Cuba. Many Cubans also went to America because of this. In 1961 the Americans helped some of these Cubans to attack Cuba and remove Castro, but they failed. Castro then asked the Soviet Union to help defend them from the Americans, which they did. The [[Soviet Union]] put nuclear weapons in Cuba and aimed them at America. American President Kennedy demanded that they be removed or a new war would begin. This was known as the ''[[Cuban Missile Crisis]]''. The Soviet Union then removed the missiles when the United States agreed to not continue attacking cuba and remove missiles from Turkey.  

Cuba became a [[communist]] led country like the Soviet Union after this. The Soviet Union bought most of Cuba’s sugar for expensive prices. Cuba spent this money on health, education and the army. This made Cuba’s schools and hospitals some of the best in the world, and the army fought in [[Africa]] to support black Africans against the white South African army. Cuba also supported groups in South America fighting against the dictators of those countries. 

However, the Cuban government began to control most of life in Cuba under the communist system. Disagreeing with the Cuban government and Fidel Castro in public was not allowed. Some Cubans did not like this and tried to leave Cuba. Most Cubans who left went to America. Some Cubans who did not like the government and stayed were put in jail. Many groups from around the world protested against Cuba because of this, and demanded that Fidel Castro give up power. 

In 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed. This meant that Cuba, which had sold most of its products to the Soviet Union, had no money coming into the country. The Americans made the restrictions against contact with Cuba tighter. America said the restrictions on contact would continue unless Fidel Castro gave up power. Cuba became very poor in the 1990s. This became known in Cuba as “The Special Period”. Because of the disaster, Cuba changed to allow less control by the government, more discussion amongst the people, and private shops and businesses. Cuba also tried to get tourists to visit the island. 

In the 2000s, tourism to Cuba began to make money for the island again. Though [[Fidel Castro]] had remained in power, he had passed all duties to his brother Raul after an illness. Fidel Castro is 87 years old and was one of the longest serving heads of state. In 2008, [[Raúl Castro]] became the official president of Cuba.

For military service, men from the age of 16 to 49 years old must go to the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cu.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook -- Cuba |work=cia.gov |accessdate=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Demographics ==
The population of Cuba is close to 13 million. The people of Cuba come from three different groups. The largest group is the descendants of the [[Spain|Spanish]] settlers who came to Cuba. The smallest group is the descendants of the black African slaves who were brought in to do the work and birth children (in the [[barracoon]]) as [[New World]] slaves who could be legally sold into life time bondage in the United States. The middle-sized group is a mix of African and Spanish. The government succeeded in seeing that the three different groups were treated the same. According to a DNA Caribbean Studies Institute, the racial-makeup of the population of Cuba is:

* [[European people|European]] Cubans descend from settlers that came during the very late 15th century and onward. Most white Cubans came from many different parts of [[Spain]], but the most numerous were the [[Canary Islands|Canary Islanders]], [[Andalusia]]ns, and Catalans. There was as well some [[France|French]], [[Italy|Italian]] and [[England|English]] peoples. Whites makeup approximately 30% of Cuba's population as of 2012, and they mostly populate the west part of Cuba, specially cities like [[Havana]] and [[Pinar de Rio Providence|Pinar del Rio]]. These brought with them their language, religions, music and others.

* [[Africa]]ns and [[Mulatto]] Cubans descend from the arrival of African slaves that came from various parts of [[Africa]] but the most numerous were West Africans. There were also more than 500,000 [[Haiti]]ans that came to Cuba during the [[Haitian Revolution]] days. Most Cuban slaves tended to come from the [[Kongo]] and [[Yoruba]] tribes, there were also the Igbos, Ewes, Fons, Fulas, Mandinkas and some others. [[Afro-Cuban]]s range enormously from 33.9 percent to 70 percent of the population, and they are mostly concentrated in the east parts of Cuba. These brought with them their instruments, reigion ([[Santeria]]), and customs to the Cuban culture.

* [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] Cubans are about 3% of the population, however; one must know that a lot of the Southern Spaniard Cuban descendants have good portion of [[Moor]] blood in their family lines; due to the close proximate Spain is to North Africa. Many Mediterranean Cubans came during the 1820s-1880s and sometimes onward. These are most concentrated in the East specially cities like [[Guantanamo Bay]]. They brought much of their foods and cuisines to Cuba and a few vocabularies.

== Health and education ==
Cuba is a [[developing country]], and is often depicted as a very [[Poverty|poor]] country. In some aspects, however, like [[education]], [[health care]] and [[life expectancy]] it ranks much better than most countries in Latin America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvard&quot;&gt;[http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/review/review_summer_02/txt677cuba.html Harvard Public Health Review/Summer 2002] The Cuban Paradox&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[infant death rate]] is lower than some developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2091rank.html |title=CIA World Factbook |publisher=Cia.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average life expectancy is 78 years.&lt;ref name=factbook/&gt;

All the children are required to go to school from six to twelve years old, and nearly everybody is able to read and write at least. There is free education at every level. Because of this,&lt;ref name = &quot;LiteracyC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/latin-lessons-what-can-we-learn-from-the-worldrsquos-most-ambitious-literacy-campaign-2124433.html |title=Latin lessons: What can we Learn from the World’s most Ambitious Literacy Campaign? |publisher=The Independent |date=2010-11-07 |accessdate=2013-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba has a 99.8% [[literacy rate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mdgs.un.org/unsd/mdg/SeriesDetail.aspx?srid=656&amp;crid=192 |title=unstats &amp;#124; Millennium Indicators |publisher=Mdgs.un.org |date=2010-06-23 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[World Food Programme]] certified Cuba to be the only country in this region without undernourished children. In the same year, the [[United Nations]] said that Cuba was the only nation in the world that met the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]]'s definition of [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Living Planet Report 2006 |url= http://assets.panda.org/downloads/living_planet_report.pdf |publisher= [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], [[Zoological Society of London|ZSL]], [[Global Footprint Network]] |date= 24 October 2006 |page= 19 |accessdate= 18 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
{{see also|List of cities in Cuba}}
Cuba is the largest island in the West Indies. It has many resources. Only about one-fourth of the land is mountains or hills. Much of the land is gentle hills or plains which are good for farming or raising cattle. Cuba has fertile soil and a warm climate that makes it great for growing crops.

Sugar is the most important crop of Cuba, and they may get it from the [[sugar cane]]. Sugar cane is the largest cash crop grown in Cuba, and it brings in most of the money. After that, the second is [[tobacco]]. Tobacco is made into [[cigar]]s by hand. A hand-made cigar is considered by many people to be the finest in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifepac&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Buskey|first=Theresa|title=History and Geography|editor=Alan Christopherson, M.S.|publisher=Alpha Omega Publications, Inc|location=804 N. 2nd Ave. E., Rock Rapids|series=LIFEPAC|pages=11|isbn=978-1-58095-158-6|accessdate=14 April 2010|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important crops are [[rice]], [[coffee]], and [[fruit]]. Cuba also has many minerals. [[Cobalt]], [[nickel]], [[iron]], [[copper]], and [[manganese]] are all on the island. Salt, [[petroleum]], and natural gas are there too.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifepac&quot;/&gt; The coast of Cuba has many [[bay]]s and a few good harbors. Havana, which is the capital, is also a [[Harbour|port]]. Other harbors have port cities. Nuevitas is a port city on the north [[coast]]. Cienfuegos, Guantánamo, and Santiago de Cubaare some of the port cities on the south coast.

Cuba has a semi-tropical climate. That means that the cool ocean winds keep it becoming hot, despite its being in the tropiocal zone. Cuba has a wet season and a dry season. The dry season is from November to April, and the wet season is from May to October. August to October is also the hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean. Because of this, most of Cuba's port cities can be flooded along the coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifepac&quot;/&gt;also found in cuba is the S.M.A assosiation lead by rohit.

[[File:Selpologne.jpg|thumb|A magnified crystal of salt]]
A '''cube''' is a block with all [[right angle]]s and whose [[height]], [[width]] and [[depth]] are all the same. 

A cube is one of the simplest [[Platonic solid|mathematical shape]]s in space. Something that is shaped like a cube is sometimes referred to as ''cubic''.

== Relative 2-dimensional shape ==
The basic difference between a cube and a [[Square (geometry)|square]] is, a cube is a [[3D]] figure (having 3 [[dimension]]s  i.e. length, breadth and height while a square has only 2 dimensions i.e. length and breadth.
The 2-dimensional ([[2D]]) shape (like a circle, square, triangle, etc.) that a cube is made of is [[square (geometry)|squares]]. The sides (faces) of a cube are squares. The edges are straight [[line]]s. The corners (vertices) are at right angles. A cube has 8 corners, 12 edges and 6 sides.example dice having six number denotes 6 faces. A [[tesseract]] carries this idea into the fourth dimension ([[4D]]) and is made of 8 cubes. 

== Volume ==
* The [[volume]] of a cube is the [[length]] of any one of the edges (they are all the same length so it does not matter which edge is used) ''cubed''. 
* This means you multiply the number by itself, and then by itself again. 
* If the edge is named 'd' (See Diagram), the equation would be this: Volume=d×d×d (or Volume=d&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).

== Cubic shaped things ==

'''December''' is the twelfth and last [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], with 31 [[day]]s, coming between [[November]] (of the same year) and [[January]] (of the next year). With the name of the month coming from the [[Latin]] ''decem'' for &quot;ten&quot;, it was the tenth month of the year before [[January]] and [[February]] were added to the [[Julian calendar|Roman calendar]].

December begins on the same day of the week as [[September]], and ends on the same day as [[April]], every year.

December's [[flower]] is the [[Daffodil|Narcissus]]. Its [[birthstone]] is the [[turquoise]]. The meaning of the turquoise is [[prosperity]].{{fact|date=December 2012}}

Some of the [[holiday]]s [[wikt:celebrate|celebrated]] in December are [[Christmas]], [[New Year's Eve]], [[Kwanzaa]], and [[Hanukkah]].

== The Month ==
[[File:Weihnachtsmarktindresden.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A [[Christmas]] market in [[Dresden]], [[Germany]] in December]]
December is the 12th and last month of every [[calendar]] year in the [[Gregorian calendar]], and is one of seven months of the year to have 31 days. [[December 31]] is followed by [[January 1]] of the following year. It begins on the same day of the week as [[September]] every year, as [[September 1]] and [[December 1]] are exactly 13 [[week]]s (91 [[day]]s) apart. It ends on the same day as [[April]] of the same year. If the following year is a [[leap year]], then [[March]] of that year would start and end on the same day of the week as December of the year that came before. [[November]] of the following year would then start on the same day of the week as December of the current year. If the following year is a [[common year]], then December of the current year starts on the same day of the week as [[June]] of that year.

The month of December has a [[solstice]], and in this month the [[Tropic of Capricorn]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] is turned towards the [[Sun]], meaning that [[December 21]] or [[December 22]] is the Northern [[Winter Solstice]] and the Southern [[Summer Solstice]]. This means that this date would have the least daylight of any day in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and the most in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. There are 24 hours of darkness at the [[North Pole]] and 24 hours of daylight at the [[South Pole]]. In each [[hemisphere]], December is the seasonal equivalent of [[June]] in the other.

In mainly Christian countries, December is dominated by [[Christmas]], which is celebrated on [[December 25]] in most of those countries, though Eastern Orthodox Christians celebrate it on [[January 7]]. It marks the birth of [[Jesus Christ]]. [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], [[January 6]], is also important in relation to Christmas. [[Advent]] starts on the [[Sunday]] on, or closest to, [[November 30]], and some countries have there own related celebration before the 25th. [[Sinterklaas]] is celebrated on [[December 5]] in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]], and St. Nicholas Day on [[December 6]] is also celebrated in some countries. The [[Scandinavia]]n countries, mainly [[Sweden]], celebrate [[St. Lucia Day]] on [[December 13]], while [[Iceland]] celebrates Thorlaksmessa on [[December 23]]. The week after Christmas is spent preparing for [[New Year]].

[[Judaism]]'s festival of light, [[Hanukkah]], is also celebrated over eight days in this month.

'''Dance''' is when people move to a [[music]]al [[rhythm]]. They may be alone, or in a group. The dance may be informal [[Play (theatre)|play]], part of a [[ritual]], or part of a [[professional]] [[performance]]. There are many kinds of dance, and every human [[society]] has its dances.

Dancing is not a sport, although it does have sporting aspects. Dance is an art. Some people dance to express their feelings and [[emotion]]s. Other people dance to feel better. Dance can be used to tell a story. In some societies, dance goes with [[song]] as well as music. People who want to learn to dance can go to dance schools. It may take years of practice to become an experienced and flexible dancer.

To plan a dance is called ''[[choreography]]'', done by a [[choreographer]].&lt;ref&gt;Crane Debra &amp; Mackrell, Judith 2000. ''The Oxford Dictionary of Dance''. Oxford University Press, Oxford. [this book only deals with ballet]&lt;/ref&gt; Often this goes with [[music]], and fits into a certain style. Dances may be planned in detail, or they may be whatever dancers feel like doing. However, most dancing does follow some general style or [[pattern]]. One style is the couple dance, where (usually) a man and a woman dance together. Other dances need a whole group of people together to make it work.

== History ==
People have always danced. Every society has its own dances. We have pictures, on [[pottery]] and [[stone]], which show dances from several thousand years ago, in [[Egypt]] and [[Greece]].&lt;ref name=Sachs&gt;Sachs, Curt 1937. ''The world history of the dance''. Norton, N.Y. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Chapter 5&lt;/sup&gt;

Sachs divides early dances into 'Imageless dances' and 'Image dances'. By 'imageless dances' he meant dances which have no set form, but aim at getting the dancers into a state of [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]]. In this state the dancer(s) seem changed, in a [[trance]], and are often thought of (by their society) as being 'possessed by [[spirits]]'. These dances are done on certain occasions: marriage, war, famine, illness or death, and so on. They are found in all early ('primitive') societies.&lt;ref name=Sachs/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p49; 62&lt;/sup&gt;

The 'image dances', according to Sachs, are to do with the world outside the dancer. By imitating an animal or object, the dancer believes he can capture a power and make it useful. To dance in imitation of the animal which is going to be hunted is to become one with them. To imitate the act of [[sex]] is to achieve [[fertility]]. This is the kind of thinking behind an image dance. Sachs points out that societies of this kind do not really understand the connection between [[Causality|cause and effect]]. They really believe the image dances work. The dance type which is used in image dances is [[mime]].&lt;ref name=Sachs/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p49; 77&lt;/sup&gt;

The two styles of dance may be joined together. Fertility dances may involve both ecstatic states and mime. The great dancer [[Nijinsky]] used some of these ideas in his [[choreography]] for the [[ballet]] ''[[Le Sacre du Printemps]]'' (The Rite of Spring), a ballet about the sacrifice of a girl during a primitive celebration of Spring.

Coming to more recent times, the first dance school we know about was opened in 1661 in [[Paris]]. Only men were accepted until 1681. After 1681, women were accepted too. [[Ballroom dance]]s are forms of modern dance. Ballroom dances such as the [[Waltz (International)|waltz]] are done by couples.

Until the 20th century, most ballroom dances were [[sequence dance]]s. The way people moved was planned in set formation. These formations were usually lines or squares. Everyone moved at the same time, and finished at the same time. The music played for a set time, and then stopped. After the invention of the [[Waltz (International)|waltz]], around 1800, another style of dancing developed.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Melusine 1952. ''Historical dances: 12th to 19th centuries''. Dance Books, London.&lt;/ref&gt; In the waltz, and later dances, people danced in couples, but they did so separately. They did not dance in formation, but moved round the room as they pleased (but anti-clockwise). Now, once again, new dance styles have arrived. Some people dance as individuals, separately as they please. [[Street dance]] is like that. But all these types of dance have music.

At the same time, round the world there are many traditional dances. Some of them have been going for hundreds of years. We call them [[folklore|folkloric]] dances.

The '''Dissolution of the monasteries''' was an event that happened from [[1536]] to [[1540]], when [[England|English]] King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] took away the land and money that the nuns and monks of the [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] church owned. Henry VIII then gave this land and money to people that supported him.

This was also when Henry VIII made himself the new head of the [[Church of England]] (which is a type of [[Christianity]]).

It all started when Henry VIII wanted to get a divorce but was refused by the Pope.
{{Spoken Wikipedia|Dissolution of the monasteries.ogg|[[19 July]] [[2006]]}}

He decided to create his own religion - the Church of England.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''deadline''' is a [[time]] by which some [[:wikt:task|task]] must be [[:wikt:complete|complete]]d.

Very often, it means a [[time limit]] that is set in place by an [[authority]] - for example, a [[teacher]] tells students that they must turn in their [[:wikt:homework|homework]] in by a certain time. This is so the teacher is able to report fairly to his or her [[principal]] that every [[student]] had the same chance to do the work.

Deadlines may also be set by a [[time horizon]] that comes from something that is not a human authority, but part of [[nature]].  For example, by [[sunset]] one must do those tasks requiring [[daylight]].  However, a human must watch the sun and decide what light is strong enough to still be daylight, so time limits will still be involved even if one observes a horizon and sets a deadline oneself.

A way to remember this is that a time horizon is like the [[Matter|physical]] [[horizon]] where sunset happens and a time limit is a thing people set up to deal with this. A deadline is a thing powerful people set up to ensure less powerful people comply with their way of doing things.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Dutton Speedwords''' is a [[constructed language | made-up language]] written by Reginald John Garfield Dutton. The [[idea]] of '''Dutton Speedwords''' is to make frequent words short, and very frequent words very short. '''Dutton Speedwords''' can be used as a second language for international communications. Dutton Speedwords is also a [[shorthand]] writing system – this means you can use it to write quickly. 

The method was made up by Reginald John Garfield Dutton (1886-1970) in 1922. It was first published in 1935. It was called ''International Symbolic Script''. A year later, it was called ''Speedwords''. It was changed in 1946 and 1951.

It has two uses; to be a language and to be used for writing quickly. Dutton hoped that this would mean more people would learn it because they could use it for two reasons.

The books that Dutton wrote about Speedwords are not printed anymore. But Speedwords is now being used by more people because they find it is good for working [[online]]. For example, it makes it faster to type an [[email]].

Another way of writing quickly is [[Pitman's shorthand]]. This uses special symbols instead of letters. Speedwords uses Roman letters. This makes it easier to learn. It also means it can be typed using a normal keyboard. Each word means only one thing. This means you do not need to use different forms of the same word.

The words used in Speedwords are the same as the words used in many other languages. The words are like short versions of the writer's own language.

In some [[religion]]s, the '''devil''' is a bad [[spirit]] that tries to create problems for people. Some people also use the words &quot;the Devil&quot; or &quot;[[Satan]]&quot; for the most powerful devil. The word &quot;devil&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;diabolos&quot; which means &quot;someone who tells lies to hurt you&quot;. (&quot;Diabolos&quot; is translated to the English word &quot;[[slander]]er.&quot;) The [[New Testament]] uses &quot;diabolos&quot; as a title for [[Satan]], and so &quot;The Devil&quot; became another name for Satan in English.

In the [[Old Testament]], there is the [[serpent]] and the '''shaitan''', who may be two different characters. &quot;Shaitan&quot; in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] means &quot;adversary&quot;, an enemy or opponent. Shaitan is also the word used for the devil in the [[Koran]], who often appears as an animal and tries to get people to do the wrong thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tfd.com/shaitan |title=shaitan |accessdate=27 December 2009 |format= |work=The Free Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Christianity]] the Devil was originally an [[angel]] in [[heaven]] called Lucifer. But he wanted to be the ruler of heaven and so he revolted against God. After a hard fight he was defeated and thrown out of heaven. Some other angels who helped him were also thrown out.

After the Devil was thrown out of heaven, he started doing bad things on the earth. He wants people to worship him instead of God. Sometimes he tries to trick people by giving them false promises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gospel-mysteries.net/devil-satan.html |title=The Devil |accessdate=17 February 2010 |format= |work=Gospel Mysteries }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other angels who were thrown out of heaven became evil spirits called demons. They obey the Devil and help him do evil things.

The [[Book of Revelation]] says that God will punish the Devil and his demons by throwing them into a Lake of Fire that burns in [[Hell]]. This will happen in the future.

Artists draw pictures of the Devil that show him as ugly and evil. But nobody knows what he may look like. Usually he is a spirit that nobody can see, but he can make himself look like a real person in order to trick people. Many modern depictions of the devil portray him as a red human-like being with [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]] and a pointed [[tail]], carrying a red [[pitchfork]].

Not all religions believe in the devil. For example, [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] do not believe in the devil.{{fact|date=October 2013}} Many [[Satanism|satanists]] believe in the devil or Satan only as a [[metaphor]], not an actual being or person.

'''Diarrhea''' (DIE-uh-REE-uh), also spelled '''diarrhoea''', happens when the body makes more watery [[feces]] than normal. In a [[baby]] it is the most common symptom of [[malnutrition]]. This means not eating enough, or well enough. Diarrhea can occur in humans as well as most other [[mammals]].

Diarrhea is not a [[disease]]. It is a [[wikt:condition|condition]] that a body can be in. However, there are many diseases that can cause your body to have diarrhea. Most are temporary and related to [[diet]] - the [[food]] you [[eat]]. [[Food safety]] and [[hand washing]] can lower the risk of getting diarrhea. [[wikt:stress|Stress]] and drinking too much [[alcohol]] or [[caffeine]] can also cause diarrhea.

In [[developing nation]]s, malnutrition is a common cause of child death.  Part of the deaths from malnutrition are caused by diarrhea. Another way diarrhea can kill you is by [[dehydration]]. Because diarrhea is watery in nature, it takes up a lot of the water in your body. Diarrhea is often treated with [[aspirin]] or [[glucose]] - these reduce [[pain]] and may stop some symptoms for a while. However, if it was because of malnutrition, it will not save the child's life. Spending money on [[rehydrating salts]], clean [[water]], and more food is the most direct way to cure diarrhea from malnutrition.

The opposite of diarrhea, firm feces are a sign of good [[digestive health]]. Many people adopt [[vegetarian]] diets with high [[dietary fibre]] to prevent diarrhea and other digestive problems.

'''Dimensions''' are a concept from [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]: One way to define a dimension is to look at the [[degree of freedom|degrees of freedom]] a movement has in in a specific space. There are different concepts where the term dimension is used and there are also different definitons. There is no definition that can satisfy all concepts. 

In a [[vector space]], a dimension is equal to the  [[cardinality]] of the minimal [[Generator (mathematics)|generator]]. It is also equal to the cardinality of the maximal set of [[linear independence|linearly independent]] [[vector]]s of that space. &quot;Normal&quot; objects in everyday life are specified by three dimenensions, which are usually called [[length]], [[width]] and [[depth]]. Mathematicians call this concept [[Euclidean space]].

Dimensions can be used to measure [[position]] too. The [[distance]] to a position from a [[start]]ing place can be measured in the length, width and height [[direction]]s. These distances are a measure of the position.

Sometimes a fourth ([[4D]]) dimension, [[time]], is used to show the [[position]] of an [[event]] in [[time]] and [[Space (physics)|space]].

==Other Dimensions==
In [[modern]] [[science]], people use other dimensions.

Dimensions like [[temperature]] and [[weight]] can be used to show the position of something in less simple [[Space (physics)|spaces]].

[[Mathematician]]s also use dimensions. In mathematics, dimensions are more general. Dimensions in mathematics might not measure things in the [[world]]. The [[rule]]s for doing [[arithmetic]] with dimensions in mathematics might be different than usual arithmetic rules.

==Dimensions and vectors==
[[Vector]]s are used to show distances and directions. Vectors are often used in [[engineering]] and [[science]], and sometimes in  [[mathematics]].

A vector is a list of [[number]]s. There is one number for each dimension. There are arithmetic rules for vectors.

For example, if Jane wants to know the position of Sally, Sally can give Jane a vector to show the position. If Jane and Sally are in the world, there are three dimensions. Therefore, Sally gives Jane a list of three numbers to show her position. The three numbers in the vector Sally gives Jane might be:
# Sally's distance north of Jane
# Sally's distance east of Jane
# Sally's height above Jane

'''Distance''' is how far one thing is from another thing. Distance is a [[measure]] of the space between two things.

==Examples of Distance==
* One ball is 5 [[Foot (unit of length)|feet]] from another ball. The distance between the two balls is 5 feet.
* John walks [[north]] at 6 [[kilometre]]s per [[hour]] for one hour. John [[walk]]s a distance of 6 kilometres. 
* A [[circle]] is a [[curve]]d [[line]]. Each point on the circle is the same distance from the [[centre]] of the circle.

==Displacement==
Distance is different from [[displacement vector|displacement]]. Displacement is the difference between a starting point and a finishing point. 

==Example of Displacement==
A and B are 1 [[metre]] apart. Tom walks from A to B. Then Tom walks from B back to A. The distance Tom walked is 2 metres. Tom's displacement is 0 metres, because Tom started at A and finished at A.

== Depth in Mathematics ==

In [[list of mathematics topics|math]], the distance between the [[near|nearest]] end and [[far|farthest]] end of an [[wikt:object|object]] is its '''depth'''.

For example, Jane [[measure]]s a [[box]].  When she measures the distance between the end of the box closest to her and the end of the box farthest away, Jane measures the box's depth.

* [[Geometry]]
* [[Width]]
* [[Height]]
* [[Length]]

== Depth in Liquids ==

For [[liquids]], the distance between the top or [[surface]] of the liquid and the bottom of the liquid is the liquid's depth.

For example, [[water]] is a liquid.  If you fill a [[container]] with water, the distance between the top of the water and the bottom of the container is the water's depth.  If the depth is big we say the water is '''deep'''.

A '''dictionary''' is a [[book]] which explains the meanings of [[word]]s or, more precisely, [[lexeme]]s. The words are arranged in [[alphabetical order]] so that they can be found quickly. The word “dictionary” comes from the [[Latin]] “dictio” (“saying”).

There are several types of dictionaries: dictionaries which explain words and how they are used, dictionaries which translate words from one [[language]] to another, dictionaries of [[biography]] which tell about famous people, technical dictionaries which explain the meanings of technical words or words connected to a particular [[subject (school)|subject]] (sometimes called a [[thesaurus]]). Some of these come close to being an [[encyclopedia]], but an encyclopedia gives a lot of extra information about things (knowledge) and does not explain the use of the language.

Dictionaries which explain what words mean will give a clear &quot;definition&quot; of the word (e.g. '''''hippopotamus''''' : a [[hoof]]ed [[mammal]] with thick [[skin]], large [[mouth]] and short [[leg]]s that lives in [[river]]s and [[lake]]s of [[Africa]].) 

Good dictionaries will also give more information about the word. It will explain how it is [[pronunciation|pronounced]]. Usually the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] is used for this. It will explain how the word is used. This is not a problem for a word like &quot;hippopotamus&quot;, but a word like &quot;put&quot; has so many different meanings that a large dictionary may have a whole page or more to explain how it can be used. It will also explain what language the word comes from (e.g. Greek &quot;hippos&quot; horse and &quot;potamus&quot; river).

A dictionary may also give the form of the word in different [[grammatical tense|tenses]], [[plural]] form etc.

== Dictionaries which translate into foreign languages ==
There are also dictionaries which translate words into foreign languages. Very often one volume (one book) will translate both ways, so half the book will be translating from English to [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and the other half from Dutch to English.

When using a dictionary to find out how to say something in another language one has to be careful to choose the right word. A word like “right” has two basic meanings in English: 1) “correct”, and 2) the opposite of “left”. Other languages are not like English: they will have different words for these different meanings. A word like “put” has many meanings. A good dictionary will have a large list of these meanings to help people find the word they want. In many languages, for example, the word “put” will be different according to whether something is being put onto something (e.g. a table) or into something (e.g. a cupboard).

== Updating dictionaries ==
Dictionaries need to be updated frequently because of the way language changes. New words are often brought into a language (e.g. lots of [[computer]] terms) or words change their meanings (e.g. “gay” or “cool”). The most famous English Dictionary is the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (or OED). Words are always being added to the OED, they are never taken out even if they are obsolete (not used any more). The OED can be accessed online (with a subscription).

A '''definition''' is an exact [[word]] or [[phrase]] of the meaning, nature, or limits of something. A definition usually answers the question ''what''. ''Defining'' means giving a definition. Other words with this meaning are ''[[wikt:description|description]]'' and ''[[explanation]]''. It describes what a word means and explains to the person when and where it can be used.

In [[mathematics]], a definition is an exact way of saying what something is.  It might not be the easiest way to say what it is, but it is used because it is exact.  It can be used in a [[mathematical proof]] about the thing.

'''Denmark''' ({{lang-da|Danmark}}), officially named the '''Kingdom of Denmark''', is a [[Nordic countries|Nordic country]] in [[Northern Europe]]. It is the furthest south of the [[Scandinavia]]n countries, to the south of Norway and south-west of Sweden (which it is connected to by a bridge). It has a south border with [[Germany]]. It borders both the [[North Sea]] to the west and the [[Baltic Sea]] to the east. Denmark is a [[developed country]] with a large [[welfare state]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Esping-Andersen&quot;&gt;Esping-Andersen, G. (1990). ''The three worlds of welfare capitalism''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 and 2007, surveys&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=4086092&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt; ranked Denmark as &quot;the happiest place in the world,&quot; based on standards of health, [[welfare]], and [[education]].

The [[capital city]] of Denmark is [[Copenhagen]], on the island of Sealand. Denmark is a [[constitutional monarchy]] (meaning the [[head of state]] is a monarch who has few established powers) with a queen, [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]]. Denmark is a parliamentary state, meaning the people appoint a [[parliament]] to make decisions for them, and it has a [[democracy|democratic government]] headed by an elected Prime Minister, who currently is [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]].

In geography, ''Denmark'' is the land in northern Europe, where the [[Danish people|Danes]] live. In the political sense, the ''Kingdom of Denmark'' also includes the [[Faroe Islands]] in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], and [[Greenland]] in [[North America]]. All three parts of the country have different languages and culture.

== History ==
Denmark was first united in the [[10th century]], during the [[Viking]] period, by the king Harald Bluetooth ({{circa|985}}), who first converted Denmark to [[Christianity]]. The Vikings are well known for invading countries.  In the [[11th century]], the Danish Vikings controlled [[England]] (the [[Danelaw]]) for a while. In 1397 Denmark, Sweden and Norway became a single country with one queen (this country was called the ''Kalmar Union'') Sweden became a separate country again in 1523. Denmark and Norway (called ''Denmark-Norway)'' stayed united, until 1814. Denmark-Norway controlled many islands in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], including the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Iceland]] and [[Greenland]]. Iceland became [[independent]] from Denmark in 1944.

[[File:Grundlovgivende rigsforsamling - Constantin Hansen.jpg|thumb|left|Meeting to write the constitution, 1848.]]
Denmark became a [[constitutional monarchy]] in [[June 5]], [[1849]] when it adopted a [[constitution]] which took away powers from the King and gave rights to ordinary Danish people. [[June 5]] is  now a holiday in Denmark, called &quot;Constitution Day&quot;.

Over the years Denmark lost many of lands that it controlled in battle. Denmark's biggest war defeat was the ''Second Schleswig War'' (in 1864) when the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein was conquered by the Kingdom [[Prussia]] (now a part of [[Germany]]). This was a big loss for Denmark and, consequently, it began a policy of [[neutral]]ity after the loss, meaning it would no longer take part in any wars or support other countries. Denmark did not take part in the [[First World War]]. 

On [[April 9]], [[1940]], Denmark was invaded by [[Nazi Germany]] and the Nazis stayed in Denmark throughout [[World War II]]. During the war, in 1943, Danes helped over 8,000 [[Jews]] to escape from Denmark into Sweden after the Nazis tried to arrest them. 

After the liberation of Denmark, one part of the country was not. That was the island of [[Bornholm]]. The German Commandant ''von Kamptz'' who was stationed there, refused to surrender to the Soviets as the German were fleeing to Bornholm and further to Sweden. The Soviets then bombed the two biggest towns [[Rønne]] and [[Nexø]]. After the Germans were captured on May 9, 1945, the Soviet Army occupied the island until April 6, 1946.

After World War Two, Denmark became a member of [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]]. Greenland and the Faroe Islands are now part of the ''Kingdom of Denmark'' and have their own governments and limited power.

== Government and politics ==
[[File:Helle Thorning-Schmidt-2.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]], the Prime Minister of Denmark.]]
Denmark has three branches of power; the [[judiciary]] (the courts), the executive (the Prime Minister and the cabinet) and the [[legislature]] (the [[Folketing|Danish parliament]]). The current Prime Minister of Denmark is [[Helle Thorning-Schmidt]], who was [[election|elected]] in September 2011 She is the first woman prime minister of Denmark.

Denmark is a Kingdom which means it has a [[monarchy|monarch]] (a king or queen). The current monarch is Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Margrethe II]]. Margrethe II does not have a lot of power (she does not make any important decisions) and has a symbolic role. Denmark became a [[constitutional monarchy]] in 1849.

Elections to the [[Folketing|parliament]] are held every four years, and the winner of the election is the party or coalition which gets the most votes and seats in the parliament. After the elections are done, several parties who are in agreement will group together to form a [[coalition]] [[government]], and the leader of the largest party becomes the prime minister.

Here is a short summary of the biggest political parties in Denmark, from left to right on the [[Politics#Left-wing and right-wing political parties|political axis]]:

* Red-Green Alliance (Danish: ''Enhedslisten''), a [[communism|communist]] party.
* Socialist People's Party (Danish: ''Socialistisk Folkeparti''), a [[socialist]] party.
* [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]] (Danish: ''Socialdemokraterne''), a [[left-wing]] party which is &quot;[[social democracy|social democratic]]&quot; (slightly socialist).
* Danish Social Liberal Party (Danish: ''Det Radikale Venstre''), a [[liberal]] party.
* [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]], Liberal Party of Denmark (Danish: ''Venstre''), a slightly [[right-wing]] liberal party.
* Conservative People's Party (Danish: ''Det Konservative Folksparti''), a [[conservatism|conservative]] party.
* Danish People's Party (Danish ''Dansk Folkeparti''), a [[right-wing]] political party who dislike [[immigration]] (people from other countries who come to live in Denmark).

=== Welfare ===
Denmark, like the other [[Nordic countries]]. is well known for being a large [[welfare]] state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Esping-Andersen&quot; /&gt; The government provides many services to the public such as free [[health care]], free [[education]] (school and college) and free housing for the poor. Danes pay high taxes to fund welfare.

== Geography ==
{{see also|List of cities in Denmark}}
[[File:Da-map.png|thumb|left|Map of Denmark]]
Denmark is the smallest of the [[Scandinavia]]n countries. The neighbours are [[Germany]] (to the south), [[Sweden]] (to the east), [[Norway]] (to the north) and the [[United Kingdom]] (to the west). The country is surrounded by the sea except for Jutland (''Jylland''), the largest part of Denmark. It is connected to Germany by land. To the south-east there is the [[Baltic Sea]], to the west the [[North Sea]], to the north the [[Skagerrak]] and to the north-east the [[Kattegat]].

The western part of Denmark is the [[peninsula]] of [[Jutland]] ({{lang-da|Jylland}}, pronounced ''yoo´-land''), bordering Germany. This is the only part of Denmark that is not an island. The rest of Denmark includes 76 islands people live on, and many tiny islands. The largest islands are Zealand (''Sjælland''), and Funen (''Fyn''). To the east is the island of [[Bornholm]] in the [[Baltic Sea]], the only place in Denmark where the bedrock can be seen.

The country is quite flat. The highest hill or mountain is Møllehøj, which is 170.86 metres (560.56&amp;nbsp;ft) tall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Danmarks nye top|journal=Aktuel Naturvidenskab | first=Jørgen | last=Dahlgaard | volume=2005|issue=1|page=2|url = http://www.aktuelnat.au.dk/pdf05_1/an1top.pdf |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080307040437/http://www.aktuelnat.au.dk/pdf05_1/an1top.pdf |archivedate = 7 March 2008|format=PDF|accessdate=20 January 2012|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are many small hills, lakes, creeks, forests and farmland. Denmark's shore line covers 7,314&amp;nbsp;km (4,545&amp;nbsp;mi).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://denmark.dk/portal/page?_pageid=374,520337&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070403235436/http://denmark.dk/portal/page?_pageid=374,520337&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL|archivedate=3 April 2007 |title=Nature &amp; Environment |accessdate=19 January 2012|work=Denmark.dk }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobody in Denmark lives more than 60&amp;nbsp;km from the coast.

=== Climate ===
The [[weather]] in Denmark is quite windy and rainy. In the [[winter]], it does not get very cold; in most years, there are only a few weeks of [[snow]]. Every ten years or so, the sea around the islands freezes over, but in most winters, it does not. The [[climate]] and [[topography]] are not good for winter sports.

Most [[summer]]s are not very hot. People always dress to be ready for rain or wind. There are also very sunny times, but nobody can know ahead of time when these will be. The best time of the year for outdoor activities is the months of May and June until midsummer.

=== Regions and municipalities ===
[[File:Map DK Regions2.png|thumb|left|A map of the regions of Denmark]]
Denmark is divided into five regions ([[Danish language|Danish]]: ''regioner'' or ''region'' for one). The regions replaced the former counties (''amter'') in January 2007. The regions are in charge of hospitals and health care.

The regions are then subdivided into municipalities ({{lang-da|kommuner}}). There are currently 98 municipalities, but before January 2007 there were 275. The number of municipalities was decreased when it was decided that, to become more efficient, each should have a population of at least 20,000 .

== People ==
[[File:Denmark-demography.png|thumb|left|175px|Population changes in Denmark the last 45 years]]
The biggest part (90.5%) of Denmark's population of just under 5.4 million is of Danish descent, according to 2009 statistics. Of the rest 8.9% who are immigrants or descendent from recent immigrants, many come from [[South Asia]] or the [[Middle East]]. There are also small groups of [[Inuit]] from [[Greenland]] and [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DSTimm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dst.dk/HomeUK/Statistics/focus_on/focus_on_show.aspx?sci=565 |title=Immigrants and their descendants and foreign nationals|work=Statistics Denmark |publisher=Dst.dk |date=12 May 2010 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danes speak the national language, [[Danish language|Danish]], which is very similar to the other [[Scandinavia]]n languages. Swedish and Norwegian are so close to Danish that most Danes understand them. 

As well as Danish, most Danes speak a foreign language too, such as [[English language|English]], which is popular as an [[international]] language, or [[German language|German]]. In the southern part of Jutland, a German minority speaks [[German language|German]]. On the [[Faroe Islands]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] is spoken, and people living in [[Greenland]] speak [[Greenlandic language|Inuit]]. 

Religion does not play a large part in the life of most Danes and church attendance is very low. However, even though many Danes are [[atheist]], 80.4%&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.km.dk/folkekirken/statistik-og-oekonomi/kirkestatistik.html Membership Lutheran state church] (''Danish'').&lt;/ref&gt; are members of the Protestant &quot;Church of Denmark&quot; ({{lang-da|Folkekirke}} (The National Church) which is the official &quot;state church&quot; of Denmark. The National Church is [[Lutheran]], which means it separated from the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the [[16th Century]]. Other important faiths include [[Judaism]], [[Islam]] (the number of Muslims is increasing), other Protestant groups and Catholicism.

== Transport ==
[[File:Storebaeltbroen.JPG|thumb|Great Belt Fixed Link is the biggest bridge in Denmark]] 
Because of the many islands, Denmark has many [[bridge]]s. The main parts of the country, and most of the bigger islands, are connected by [[road]]s and [[railroad]]s. One of the world's longest bridges connects the eastern and the western parts of the country, and there is a large bridge to Sweden also. There is still no bridge across the Baltic Sea to Germany, but it will most likely be built in a few years.  The bridge to Sweden was expensive, took a long time to build, and required much planning by engineers.

There are still many islands with no bridges to the mainland. People have to go by [[boat]] or [[airplane]] to reach these islands. Many islands will never be reached by bridges, because they are too small or too far away.  If the island has too few people, bridges are often not built because it is expensive to build.  Somebody has to pay for it, nothing is free.

[[Cycling]] is very popular in Denmark because the ground is so flat. [[Copenhagen]] is a city that is very bicycle friendly, with bicycle lanes extending over 12,000&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.visitdenmark.dk/danmark/da-dk/menu/turist/inspiration/aktivferie/cykel/cykel-ruter-og-regioner.htm | title = Cykelruter og regioner | accessdate = 20 January 2012 | publisher=Visitdenmark.com | language = Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
The people of Denmark have always depended on the sea. In earlier days, people could not travel anywhere unless they went by boat. Many Danes were [[fishing|fishermen]] or [[merchant]]s. Even today, many Danes spend much time near or at the sea.

[[Farm]]ing has always been one of the main [[Profession|occupations]]. Because of the [[climate]] and the [[soil]], Denmark is a good place for [[agriculture]]. [[Export]] of food to the neighbouring countries is one of the most important sources of [[income]] for the country.  Danish hams and cookies are exported throughout the world.

Perhaps the most famous Dane is actually [[Hamlet]], the title character of [[William Shakespeare]]'s famous play, which was set in the real castle of Kronborg in [[Helsingør]], north of Copenhagen. The play was based on an old Danish myth of the [[Viking]] Prince Amled of Jutland, and his quest for revenge against his father's killer. Another widely known Dane is [[Hans Christian Andersen]], an [[author]] mostly famous for such [[fairy tale]]s as &quot;[[The Little Mermaid]]&quot;, and &quot;[[The Ugly Duckling]]&quot;. Also [[Karen Blixen]], [[Tycho Brahe]] and the philosopher [[Søren Kierkegaard]] are well-known world wide. There are many famous Danish scientists, including [[Niels Bohr]], the famous physicist who developed the first working model for the [[atom]], and [[Ole Rømer]], who discovered the [[speed of light]]. Hans Kirk, although less well-known outside of Denmark, is the author of the best-selling Danish novel of all time, ''The Fishermen''.

=== Music ===
Danes enjoy many different types of music, including [[ballet]]s, [[jazz music]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music|rock]]. Denmark's most famous [[classical music|classical]] [[composer]] is  [[Carl Nielsen]]. Famous Danish bands include [[Aqua (band)|Aqua]], a pop band, and [[The Raveonettes]], an indie rock band. The most famous Danish rock star is [[Lars Ulrich]] of the band [[Metallica]]. 

=== Food  ===
[[File:Smørrebrød 5.jpg|thumb|170px|Danish open sandwich (''smørrebrød'') on dark rye bread. A popular food item in Denmark.]] 
The [[cuisine]] of Denmark is like the other Nordic countries ([[Finland]], [[Norway]], [[Iceland]], and [[Sweden]]), as well as that of northern [[Germany]], consists mainly [[pork]] [[meat]] and [[fish]]. Traditional Danish food includes ''frikadeller'' (fried [[meatball]]s, often served with [[potato]]es and various sorts of [[sauce|gravy]]). Fish is also widely eaten, especially on the west coast of [[Jutland]].

=== Holidays ===
[[Christmas]] ({{lang-da|Jul}}) is the main feast of the year. Christmas is traditionally celebrated on the eve, [[December 24]], and this is when the main Christmas meal is eaten and presents are unwrapped.

In midwinter, a [[fasting|fast]] is celebrated. Children are dressed up, and go from house to house begging for money. This practice has in the recent years been taken over by [[Halloween]], and most people give candy not money. A barrel filled with candy is smashed with clubs. The person who makes the candy fall out is appointed queen of cats and the person who hits the last stick is appointed king of cats.

Midsummer is celebrated with a huge bonfire in the evening of [[June 23]]. Most Danes have a three week summer holiday in July or August.

=== Sports ===
The most popular sport in Denmark is [[Football (soccer)|football]] (soccer). Sailing, swimming and other water sports are very popular because of the long coastline. Another common sport is cycling, (Copenhagen has been nicknamed the &quot;City of Cyclists&quot; because of the popularity of bicycles for moving around), which has become popular in Denmark partly because of the flat land all over the country. Indoor sports such as badminton and handball are also popular during the long winters.

== Monarchy ==
[[File:Royal Wedding Stockholm 2010-Konserthuset-421.jpg|thumb|right|Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]] (left) and her husband, Prince Henrik (right).]]
[[Monarch]] is a word that means [[king]] or [[queen]]. Denmark is the oldest monarchy in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nettyroyal.nl/denmark2.html Danish Royal Family]. Nettyroyal.nl.&lt;/ref&gt;  The current monarch is [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen Margrethe II]], who has been the queen since [[1972]]. Denmark does not currently have a [[King]]. Margrethe's husband is called a [[prince]] because he is the son-in-law, not the [[son]], of the previous King.  The royal couple have two [[children]]:

[[File:SkullFromTheFront.JPG|thumb|upright|The human [[skull]] is often used as a [[symbol]] for death]]
'''Death''' is the end of [[life]] in an [[organism]]. All [[Biology|biological]] [[function]]s of the living thing stop, including the [[mind]] and the [[sensory system|sense]]s. The usual [[Signs and symptoms|signal]] for death is that the [[heart]] stops beating and cannot be restarted. This can be caused by many things. All living things have a limited lifespan, and all living things eventually die.

Living things which have died are normally described as being '''dead'''. Death of humans is often investigated for the cause, in case of [[crime]] (such as [[murder]]) or [[disease]] that may continue to kill other humans. About 150,000 people die every day around the world.&lt;ref name=degrey&gt;{{cite journal | last = Aubrey D.N.J | first = de Grey | authorlink = | title = Life span extension research and public debate: societal considerations | journal = Studies in Ethics, Law, and Technology | volume = 1 | issue = 1, Article 5 | year = 2007 | url = http://www.mfoundation.org/files/sens/ENHANCE-PP.pdf | format = PDF | doi = 10.2202/1941-6008.1011 | accessdate = March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; About two thirds of these people die because of [[ageing|age]].&lt;ref name=degrey/&gt; In addition to the physical body, some believe humans also have a [[soul]] and believe that the soul can continue without a body ([[afterlife]]), move into another body ([[reincarnation]]), or cease to exist ([[annihilationism]]). [[Religion]]s have different beliefs about this issue. Many cultures have their own [[custom]]s and [[ritual]]s to respect the dead.

When people talk about things or events that lead to the death of a plant or animal, those things or events are usually described as being deadly, or fatal. In the case of diseases, they are described as ''terminal''. Humans are no different from any other lifeform. Our bodies have an ability for self-repair, but that ability is limited. Finding the cause of death is a medical speciality called [[pathology]]. In [[medicine]], death is when the heart stops beating for more than several minutes. There are special times in which people recover even though the heart has stopped for 30 minutes, such as near-drowning in very cold water. If machines are used to help the heart and lungs work, then the moment of death is more difficult to know.

== Society and culture ==
[[File:Placid death.JPG|thumb|Dead bodies can be [[Mummification|mummified]] either naturally or by intention.]]
Death is commonly a sad or unpleasant thing to people. It can make people think about their own death. People might miss the person who has died. They might also be sad for the family and friends of the person who has died.

In any society, human death is surrounded by [[ritual]] - a [[Funeral|wake]] or [[funeral]] is normal.  In some places it was common to ''eat'' the dead in a form of [[ritual]] [[cannibalism]].  But this is no longer common, in part because [[disease]] like [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]] can be passed this way. Human dead bodies are [[taboo]] in most societies and must be handled in special ways - for a combination of religious and [[hygiene]] reasons.  A human dead body must always be reported in [[law]], to be sure it is disposed of properly.

=== Dealing with dead bodies and their property ===

Finding the cause of any human death and stopping a similar death from happening to someone else are the main reasons people look into ''[[human morbidity]]'' or let dead bodies be cut open and looked at in an [[autopsy]].  Some religions do not allow autopsies, because they feel the body is holy. Autopsies are usually required by the [[state]] if someone dies and people do not know why. The autopsy helps find out if someone killed the person on purpose, tried to hurt them, or if they died from a sickness.

To prepare for their own death, humans can write a [[last will and testament]] to be clear about who gets their [[property]].  A person will sometimes also volunteer to be an [[organ donor]]. This might mean giving the whole body to [[medical research]].  It can also save the lives of others by making [[organ transplant]]s possible.

=== Religious views of death ===

For a long time, many people have been afraid of death and a lot of people have wondered about what may happen to people after they die.  This is one of the largest questions of [[philosophy]] and [[religion]]. Many people believe there is some form of [[afterlife]].

Ancient rulers sometimes did insist not only that their own bodies, and much property, but even their servants and relatives be destroyed at their funeral.  In [[India]] this ritual still does sometimes occur.  Old women sometimes carry guns in case their husband's relatives come to throw them on the funeral fire.

[[Christianity]] has a special focus on death because of the state killing of [[Jesus Christ]] by the Romans.  In [[Islam]] this is thought to demonstrate the injustice of human systems of dealing out death, and the ability of the best people to overcome it and even forgive it{{fact|date=March 2013}}.  In [[Christianity]] itself it is thought to prove that Jesus himself was really [[God]] and so could lose his body and still have the power of [[resurrection]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Gospel of John]] 10:38&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Buddhism]] [[reincarnation]] is believed to occur. Reincarnation is an idea taken from [[Hinduism]].

[[Confucianism]] advises respect for parents and forms of [[ancestor]] [[worship]] to respect both dead and living ancestors.

=== Rituals surrounding death ===

Every [[ethical tradition]] including the medical view of the body has some ritual surrounding death.  Often these excuse behaviours that might be hated if they did not have the ritual.  For instance, one may say that [[organ transplant]] is like [[cannibalism]].

Very much of what happens at a human death is ritual.  People who wish theirs to be dealt with a certain way, and who wish a particular treatment like [[cremation]] of their body, should decide in advance and set up the necessary payments and agreements.  This makes it much easier for their family after they die, since there is no longer the ability to clearly communicate the wish.

For the same reason, saying goodbye is important.  Most of the [[wikt:stress|stress]] of death seems to come for loved ones who &quot;did not have a chance to say goodbye&quot;.

Maybe it is to relieve this stress that rituals are created, and to bring together those that knew someone so that the personal experience a person can no longer communicate for themselves, can be exchanged by others.

Some ritual, such as seances, claim to allow people to speak to the dead. This is not claimed to be very reliable, both by [[scientists]] and even by those who do them very often.

== Preparing for death ==

Aside from wills, goodbyes, organ donations and funerals, there is important personal experience to decide to pass on, or not, when someone knows they may soon die.  Palliative care focuses on basic decisions people make when they are very close to the end of their lives, and it ensures someone is always available to talk to them.  It is a replacement for heroic medical intervention that may keep them physically alive but with no [[quality of life]].  Human [[psychology]] must prepare for death if it is anything other than a quick surprise:

[[Elizabeth Kubler-Ross]] wrote that there were several stages in [[dying]], of which denial was the first, and acceptance was the last.  Recording one's life is often something people with acceptance will do to leave a [[memoir]] or a full [[autobiography]]:

Because events leave [[living memory]], and may only be part of [[oral tradition]], there are projects to record everything that people remember about [[World War I]] and the [[Shoah]].  The first of these was to record everything remembered about the [[U.S. Civil War]].  This discipline has changed [[history]] since we have so many more [[first person account]]s of the times, and made [[social history]] much more standard.

== Other terms for death ==
There are other [[term]]s for death. Examples are, &quot;to pass away&quot;, &quot;to go to a better place&quot;, &quot;to buy the farm&quot; (generally used in the [[military]]), &quot;to leave the earth&quot;, and &quot;to kick the bucket&quot;. the term ''gone'' may also be a term for describing death. ''for example'': if a person has died, they are also said to be ''gone'', as in ''gone to a better place''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''diesel-electric''' [[engine]] burns [[diesel]] or [[biodiesel]] [[fuel]]. However, rather than use this [[energy]] directly to run gears, it charges a [[battery]] which more efficiently turns wheels.

Some designs also store [[braking energy]] in a [[flywheel]], which can also charge a battery. However, these make the engine even more complex, and add weight to the vehicle, so are more appropriate for [[city driving]] where [[service station]]s are always available and there is much [[stop and go driving]].

Because they do not require any change or [[investment]] in stations nor much in [[vehicle design]], diesel-electric vehicles are believed to be the most likely replacement for today's [[internal combustion engine]]. When properly tuned, they have low [[emission]]s and they use only about one-third of the [[fossil fuel]] of most [[gasoline]] engines powering similar vehicles.

[[Honda]] and [[Toyota]] are presently delivering consumer priced diesel-electric cars. By contrast, [[hydrogen infrastructure]] is thought to be decades off, and is not fully implemented even in [[Iceland]] where there is abundant free [[geothermal electricity]].

Many [[activist]]s feel that promoting hydrogen is a stall, a way to avoid forcing the shift to diesel-electric vehicles in the nearer term.

{{wiktionary|Europe}}
'''Europe''' is a [[continent]], the western part of [[Eurasia]]. It is not part of [[Asia]], because of a [[tradition]]al [[east]]ern [[border|boundary]] that includes the [[Ural Mountains]] in [[Russia]] and the [[Bosporus]] in [[Turkey]], and from [[Africa]] by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to Balkans. The [[Atlantic Ocean]] is to the west of Europe. There are over 50 countries in Europe. [[Andreas M. Kaplan]] describes Europe as &quot;embracing maximum cultural diversity at minimal geographical distances&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006|title=Andreas M. Kaplan: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools, European Management Journal, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]] is made up of most of the countries in Europe. The city with the most people in Europe is [[Istanbul]].

== Origin of Name ==

Europe is named after a person in Greek [[mythology]] called Europa. She was said to have been abducted to [[Crete]] by Zeus. The name was later used for [[Greece]]. Then as the rest of the area we call Europe started to have cities and empires, the whole area West of the [[Ural Mountains]] became known by the same name.

== Regions ==

*[[Eastern Europe|Eastern]]
*[[Central Europe|Central]]
*[[Western Europe|Western]]
*[[Northern Europe|Northern]]
*[[Southern Europe|Southern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]]

== Climate ==
In Europe there are different [[climate]]s in different places; for example, in the north like [[Finland]] it stays snowy in the winter for 5–6 months and is about -30 degrees Celsius. However, during winter in [[Spain]] it is warmer and hardly snows, except on high mountains.

== European Union ==

At this time, much of the continent shares some rulership in a body that is above any country, called the [[European Union]].

== History ==

The history of Europe is long and has many turns. Individual specific 'eras' - this is the term meaning long amounts of specific time - can be mentioned:

* Pre-historic (Paleolithic, Mesolithic Neolithic) - 2,600,000 years ago to 5000
* Ancient Greek Civilisation (Minoan, Classical, Hellenistic) - 3000-100 BC
* Roman Civilisation
* Medieval Civilisation (early, high, late) 400 AD-1500 AD
* Early Modern Era (Renaissance, Reformation, Age of Discovery, French Revolution and Napeoleonic Wars) 1500-1800
* Industrialisation 1800-1914
* World War I - 1914-1918
* Interwar Period - 1918-1939
* World War II - 1939-1945
* Cold War - 1945-1989
* Contemporary era - 1989-2008{{fact|date=November 2012}}
* Post-Contemporary era - 2009-2011

An '''encyclopedia''' (or ''encyclopædia'', ''cyclopædia'', ''encyclopaedia'') is a collection (usually a book) of [[information]] about things [[human]]s [[knowledge|know]]. Whether it is [[Publishing|published]] on paper or online, an encyclopedia is a collection of articles, each on a different subject. The first encyclopedias may have begun as lecture notes by and for teachers of ancient schools, such as [[Aristotle]]’s school. Each volume in the encyclopedia was for a different subject or course of study. The word encyclopedia at first meant the teachings of the school. The name &quot;encyclopedia&quot; is from the [[16th century]].

After the [[printing press]] was invented, dictionaries with long definitions began to be called encyclopedias. For example, a [[dictionary]] of science, if it included [[essay]]s, was thought of as an encyclopedia or knowledgeable book on the subject of science. Some encyclopedias then put essays on more than one subject in alphabetical order instead of grouping them together by subject. The word, encyclopedia, was put in the title of some encyclopedias. 

Companies were started for the purpose of publishing encyclopedias for the public use in libraries, which is different from when an encyclopedia was the curriculum of a private school. Like dictionaries, these publishers hired hundreds of experts to write articles and read and choose articles. Some internet encyclopedias allowed their paying customers to submit articles. Other internet encyclopedias accepted writing from non-paying users of the encyclopedia. Encyclopedias are a great source of knowledge. They are included with many different topics.

== Types of encyclopedias ==
There are different types of encyclopedias. Some are general and have pages on lots of topics. The English language ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' and German ''[[Brockhaus]]'' are general encyclopedias. Some are about specific topics. For example, there are encyclopedias of [[medicine]] or [[philosophy]]. There are also some encyclopedias that have lots of topics with one [[wikt:perspective|perspective]] or one cultural [[bias]]. The ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' is one of these.

Many [[dictionary|dictionaries]] have different sorts of information to encyclopedias. Examples are the Dictionary of National Biography, the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships, and [[Black's Law Dictionary]].

There are two main ways of organizing encyclopedias: from A to Z (the [[alphabet]]ical way) or by categories. Most encyclopedias go from A to Z.

There are also printed encyclopedias, and encyclopedias in the computer, such as [[Wikipedia]].

== Encyclopedias ==
The largest online encyclopedia in the English language is [[Wikipedia]] in [[English language|English]], which has more than 4 million articles now. The second largest is the [[Encyclopaedia Britannica]], which is the largest one that is [[Publishing|printed]]. Some languages have a larger printed encyclopedia. Stacy Schiff, a writer, says that Wikipedia is not as good as other encyclopedias because anyone can change it, so some people may write things that are wrong. Also, the way that Wikipedia works means that there is likely to be [[bias]].&lt;ref&gt;

|quote=The sad truth is that &quot;non-fiction&quot; has been unreliable from the beginning, no matter how finely grained a section of human knowledge we wish to consider. For instance, in my own field, critics have tried to replicate the findings in academic journal articles by economists using the initial data sets. Usually, it is impossible to replicate the results of the article even half of the time. Note that the journals publishing these articles often use two or three referees--experts in the area--and typically they might accept only 10 percent of submitted papers.

'''Earth science''' is an all-embracing term for the [[science]]s related to the planet [[Earth (planet)|Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=earth%20science Wordnet Search: Earth science]&lt;/ref&gt; Earth science may also be called '''geoscience'''. 

It is a broader term than [[geology]] because it includes aspects of [[planetary science]], which is part of [[astronomy]]. The Earth sciences include the study of the [[atmosphere]], [[ocean]]s and [[biosphere]], as well as the solid earth. Typically Earth scientists will use tools from [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[chronology]] and [[mathematics]] to understand the Earth, and how it evolved to its current state.

If there is one fact which underlies all Earth science it is this: the Earth is an ancient [[planet]] which has been changing the whole time since its [[Age of the Earth|formation]]. The extent of the changes is much greater than people used to think.&lt;ref&gt;Van Andel, Tjeerd 1994.

The following disciplines are generally recognised as being within the geosciences:
* [[Geology]] describes the [[Rock (geology)|rocky]] parts of the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]] (or [[lithosphere]]) and its historic development. Major subdisciplines are [[mineralogy]] and [[petrology]], [[geochemistry]], [[geomorphology]], [[paleontology]], [[stratigraphy]], [[structural geology]], engineering [[geology]] and [[sedimentology]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Simon &amp; Lambert, David 2006.

* [[Geophysics]] and [[Geodesy]] investigate the shape of the Earth, its reaction to forces and its [[magnetic field|magnetic]] and [[gravity]] fields. Geophysicists explore the [[Planetary core|Earth's core]] and [[Earth's mantle|mantle]] as well as the [[Plate tectonics|tectonic]] and [[Seismology|seismic]] activity of the lithosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;smith 5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=geodesy Wordnet Search: Geodesy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oceanservice.noaa.gov/education/kits/geodesy/welcome.html NOAA National Ocean Service Education: Geodesy]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Soil science]] covers the outermost layer of the Earth's crust that is subject to soil formation processes (or [[pedosphere]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://soil.gsfc.nasa.gov/ped/pedosph.htm Elissa Levine, 2001, The Pedosphere As A Hub]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~doetqp-p/courses/env320/lec1/Lec1.html Duane Gardiner, Lecture: Why study soils? excerpted from Miller R.W. &amp; D.T. Gardiner, 1998. ''Soils in our environment'', 8th Edition]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Oceanography]] and [[hydrology]] (includes [[limnology]]) describe the marine and freshwater domains of the [[water]]y parts of the Earth (or [[hydrosphere]]). Includes [[Marine biology]].
* [[Glaciology]] covers the [[ice|icy]] parts of the Earth (or [[cryosphere]]).
* Atmospheric sciences cover the [[gas]]eous parts of the Earth (or [[atmosphere]]) between the surface and the [[exosphere]] (about 1000&amp;nbsp;km). Major subdisciplines are [[meteorology]], [[climatology]], atmospheric [[chemistry]] and [[physics]].
* Closely related to the earth sciences are [[physical geography]] and [[biology]].

The '''Earth''' is the third planet from the [[Sun]] and it is the only planet known to have [[life]] on it. The Earth [[Age of the Earth|formed around 4.5 billion years ago]].&lt;ref name=&quot;age earth&quot;&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://sp.lyellcollection.org/cgi/content/abstract/190/1/205|title=The age of the Earth in the twentieth century- a problem (mostly) solved|accessdate=2009-07-28|publisher=Geological Society, London, Special Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of four [[terrestrial planet|rocky planets]] on the inside of the [[Solar System]]. The other three are [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], and [[Mars (planet)|Mars]].

The large [[mass]] of the Sun makes the Earth [[orbit|move around it]], just as the mass of the Earth makes the [[Moon]] move around it. The Earth also turns round in space, so different parts face the Sun at different times. The Earth goes around the [[Sun]] once (one &quot;[[year]]&quot;) for every 365¼ times it turns all the way around (one &quot;[[day]]&quot;).

The Moon goes around the Earth about every 27⅓ days, and reflects light from the Sun. As the Earth goes round the Sun at the same time, the changing light of the Moon takes about 29½ days to go from dark to bright to dark again. That is where the idea of &quot;[[month]]&quot; came from. However, now most months have 30 or 31 days so they fit into one year.

The Earth is the only [[planet]] in our Solar System that has a large amount of [[liquid]] [[water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4202901/|title=Rover reveals Mars was once wet enough for life|accessdate=28 July 2009|publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 71[[percent|%]] of the surface of the Earth is covered by [[ocean]]s. Because of this, it is sometimes called the &quot;Blue Planet&quot;.{{refn|''Blue Planet'' is a poetic title for the Earth used in [[movie]]s, in [[magazine|cheap paper book]]s, in [[poetry]], and in government reports (such as the [[European Space Agency]]'s &quot;[http://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bulletin137/bul137b_drinkwater.pdf Exploring the water cycle of the 'Blue Planet']&quot;)}}

Because of its water, the Earth is home to millions of species of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1988Sci...241.1441M|title= How many species are there on Earth|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=purves_et_al2001&gt;{{cite book | author=Purves, William Kirkwood ''et al'' | title=Life, the science of biology| publisher=Macmillan | page=455 | year=2001 | isbn=0716738732 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The things that live on Earth have changed its surface greatly. For example, early [[cyanobacteria]] changed the [[Atmosphere of Earth#History of Earth's atmosphere|air]] and gave it [[oxygen]]. The living part of the Earth's surface is called the &quot;[[biosphere]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.space.com/searchforlife/life_origins_001205.html|title= Origins of life on Earth|accessdate=2009-07-28|publisher=Space.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orbit and turning==
[[File:AxialTiltObliquity.png|thumb|right|300px|The Earth turns at an angle (an &quot;[[axial tilt]]&quot;) in relation to its path around the Sun.]]
The Earth is part of the eight [[planet]]s and many thousands of small bodies that move around the [[Sun]] as its [[Solar System]]. The Solar System is moving through the [[Orion Arm]] of the [[Milky Way]] [[Galaxy]] now, and will be for about the next 10,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/030827a.html|title=Earth's location in the Milky Way|accessdate=2009-08-06|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Earth is generally {{convert|150,000,000|km|mi|sp=us|disp=or|sigfig=2}} away from the [[Sun]] (this distance is named an &quot;[[Astronomical Unit]]&quot;). The Earth moves along its way at an [[average]] speed of about {{convert|30|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or|sigfig=2}} a second.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/earthfact.html|title=NASA- an Earth fact sheet|accessdate=2009-08-06|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Earth turns all the way around about 365¼ times in the time it takes for the Earth to go all the way around the [[Sun]].&lt;ref name=IERS&gt;{{cite web | author=Staff | date=2007-08-07 | url=http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/models/constants.html | title=Useful Constants | publisher=International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service| accessdate=2008-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To make up this extra bit of a day every year, an [[leap day|additional day]] is used every four years. This is named a &quot;[[leap year]]&quot;.

[[The Moon]] goes around the Earth at an [[average]] distance of {{convert|250,000|mi|km|sp=us|disp=or|disp=flip|sigfig=2}}. It is locked to Earth, so that it always has the same half facing the Earth; the other half is called the &quot;[[Dark Side of the Moon]]&quot;. It takes about 27⅓ days for the Moon to go all the way around the Earth but, because the Earth is moving around the Sun at the same time, it takes about 29½ days for the Moon to go from dark to bright to dark again. This is where the word &quot;[[month]]&quot; came from, even though most months now have 30 or 31 days.

== History of the Earth ==
{{seealso|Historical geology|Age of the Earth|Giant impact hypothesis|Great Oxygenation Event}}

The [[Age of the Earth|Earth]] and the other [[planet]]s formed about 4.6 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;age_earth&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Dalrymple | first=G.

&lt;/ref&gt; They were made of the leftover [[gas]] from the [[nebula]] that [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|made the Sun]]. The Moon may have been formed after a collision between the early Earth and a smaller planet (sometimes called ''Theia''). Scientists believe that parts of both planets broke off — becoming (by [[gravity]]) the Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v412/n6848/abs/412708a0.html|title=Origin of the Moon in a giant impact near the end of the Earth's formation|accessdate=2009-07-28|publisher=Nature.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earth's water came from different places. [[Condensation|Condensing]] [[water vapour]], [[comet]]s and [[asteroid]]s hitting the Earth made the [[ocean]]s. Within a billion years (that is at about 3.6 billion years ago) the first [[life]] [[evolution|evolved]], in the [[Archaean]] [[era]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewnews.html?id=258|title=Earth life appeared on land 1.5 billion years earlier than previously thought|accessdate=2009-07-03|publisher=SpaceRef.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[bacteria]] developed [[photosynthesis]], which lets plants make [[food]] from the [[Sun]]'s [[light]] and [[water]]. This released a lot of [[oxygen]], which was first taken up by [[iron]] in [[solution]]. Eventually, free oxygen got into the [[atmosphere]] or air, making the Earth's surface [[wikt:suitable|suitable]] for [[aerobic]] life (see [[Great Oxygenation Event]]). This oxygen also formed the [[ozone]] [[wikt:layer|layer]] which protects the Earth from bad [[ultraviolet]] [[radiation]] from the [[Sun]]. This protection made it possible for things to move from the deep ocean to the surface.

The Earth was very different in the distant past. Long ago, almost all land was in one place. This is called a [[continent|supercontinent]]. The earliest known supercontinent was called [[Vaalbara]]. Much later, there was a time (the [[Cryogenian]]) when the Earth was almost entirely covered by thick ice sheets ([[glacier]]s).&lt;ref name=snearth&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910075356/http://www.eps.harvard.edu/people/faculty/hoffman/snowball_paper.html|title=The Snowball Earth|accessdate=2009-07-28|publisher=Harvard University|work=Paul F.

== What it is made of ==
[[File:Terrestrial planet size comparisons.jpg|thumb|right|A rough comparison of the size of Earth and the other large rocks in our [[Solar System]]: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], and [[Mars]].]]

The Earth is [[Rock (geology)|rocky]]. It is the largest of the rocky planets moving around the Sun by mass and by size. It is still much, much smaller than the [[gas giant|gas planets]] such as [[Jupiter]], though.

=== Chemical make-up ===
Over all, the Earth is made of [[iron]] (32.1[[percent|%]]), [[oxygen]] (30.1[[percent|%]]), [[silicon]] (15.1[[percent|%]]), [[magnesium]] (13.9[[percent|%]]), [[sulfur]] (2.9[[percent|%]]), [[nickel]] (1.8[[percent|%]]), [[calcium]] (1.5[[percent|%]]), and [[aluminium]] (1.4[[percent|%]]). The 1.2[[percent|%]] left over is made of many different kinds of other chemicals. Chemicals that are very uncommon (such as [[gold]] and [[platinum]]) can be very valuable.

The structure of the Earth changes from the inside to the outside. The [[Planetary core|center of the earth]] (the &quot;core&quot;) is mostly iron (88.8%), nickel (5.8%), sulfur (4.5%), and less than 1% other things.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan J.W. &amp; Anders E. 1980. Chemical composition of Earth, Venus, and Mercury. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Science'' '''77''' (12): 6973–6977. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC350422/?tool=pmcentrez] Full free text&lt;/ref&gt; The [[crust (geology)|surface]] (the &quot;crust&quot;) is largely [[oxygen]] (47[[percent|%]]). [[Oxygen]] is normally a gas but it can [[oxide|join]] with other [[chemicals]] to make [[chemical compound|compounds]] like [[water]] and rocks. 99.22[[percent|%]] of rocks have [[oxygen]] in them. The most common [[oxygen]]-having rocks are [[silica]] (made with [[silicon]]), [[alumina]] (made with [[aluminum]]), [[rust]] (made with [[iron]]), [[lime (rock)|lime]] (made with [[calcium]]), [[magnesia]] (made with [[magnesium]]), [[potash]] (made with [[potassium]]), and [[soda]] (made with [[sodium]]), but there are others as well.&lt;ref&gt;Chisholm, Hugh (editor). &quot;Petrology&quot; in the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 11th edition.

=== Shape ===
The Earth's [[shape]] is a [[spheroid|ball]] that is a little [[oblate|squashed]] on the top and bottom. This is because the Earth turns around itself very quickly, pushing the middle out a little and pulling the top and bottom in a little. The [[equator]], the line around the middle of the Earth, is about {{convert|40,075|km|mi|sp=us|disp=or|sigfig=4}} long and, generally, the Earth is about {{convert|12,742|km|mi|sp=us|disp=or|sigfig=4}} [[diameter|wide]] (though, again, that changes a little when you go from the top or bottom to the middle.) When you make an overall comparison, the Earth looks very, very round but, because the Earth is so big, the highest mountain above [[sea level]]&amp;mdash;the well-known [[Mount Everest]] (which is {{convert|8.8|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or|sigfig=2}} [[elevation|above sea level]])&amp;mdash;is ''not'' actually the one that is the farthest away from the center of the Earth. Instead, the sleeping [[volcano]] [[Mount Chimborazo]] in [[Ecuador]] is: it is only {{convert|6.3|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or|sigfig=2}} [[elevation|above sea level]] but it is almost at the [[equator]]. Because of this, Mount Chimborazo is {{convert|6,384.4|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on|disp=or|sigfig=5}} from the center of the Earth, while [[Mount Everest]] is {{convert|2.1|km|mi|sp=us|disp=or|sigfig=2}} closer to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profsurv.com/archive.php?issue=42&amp;article=589|title=Did Edmund Hilary climb the wrong mountain?|publisher = ''Professional Surveyor Magazine'' |work = May 2000 Volume 20 Number 5|first = Joseph H. |last = Senne| date = May 2000|accessdate = 2008-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lancet365_9462_831&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sharp | first=David | title=Chimborazo and the old kilogram | journal=The Lancet | date=2005-03-05 | volume=365 | issue=9462 | pages=831–832 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)71021-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tall_tales&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/k2/moments/s1086384.htm | title=Tall tales about highest peaks | publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate=2008-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the lowest point below sea level that we are conscious of is the [[Challenger Deep]] in the [[Mariana Trench]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

=== What it is like inside ===
[[File:Earth-crust-cutaway-english.svg|thumb|right|A picture of the inside of the Earth, showing the different levels. In fact, the air and the outside levels are much thinner than shown here]]

The [[Kola superdeep borehole|deepest hole ever dug]] is only about {{convert|12.3|km|mi|disp=or|sp=us|sigfig=2}}. We know a lot about the inside of the Earth, though, because we can learn things from [[earthquake]]s and the times when [[volcano]]es [[eruption|erupt]]. We are able to see how quickly the [[shock wave]]s move through the Earth in different places.

The inside of the Earth is very different from the outside. Almost all of Earth's liquid water is in the [[ocean|sea]]s or close to the surface. The surface also has a lot of [[oxygen]], which comes from plants. Small and simple kinds of life can live far under the earth, but animals and plants only live on the surface or in the seas. The rocks on the surface of the Earth (the &quot;[[crust (geology)|crust]]&quot;) are well known. They are thicker where there is land, between {{convert|30|to|50|km|mi|disp=or|sp=us|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} thick. Under the [[ocean|sea]]s they are sometimes only {{convert|6|km|mi|disp=or|sp=us|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agu.org/reference/gephys/15_tanimoto.pdf|title=Crustal Surface of the Earth|author=Toshiro Tanimoto|accessdate=2009-08-02|publisher=American Geophysical Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three groups of rocks that make up most of the outside of the Earth. Some rock is made when the hot liquid rock comes from inside the earth (&quot;[[igneous rock]]s&quot;); another type of rock is made when [[sediment]] is laid down, usually under the sea (&quot;[[sedimentary rock]]s&quot;); and a third kind of rock is made when the other two are changed by very high [[temperature]] or [[pressure]] (&quot;[[metamorphic rock]]s&quot;). A very few rocks also fall out of the sky (&quot;[[meteorite]]s&quot;).

Below the crust is warm and almost-[[liquid]] rock that is always moving around (the &quot;[[mantle (geology)|mantle]]&quot;). Then, there is a thin liquid layer of very heated rock (the &quot;[[outer core]]&quot;). This is very hot: {{convert|7000|°C|°F|disp=or|sigfig=2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chianti.geol.ucl.ac.uk/~dario/pubblicazioni/PTRSA2002.pdf|title=The ab initio simulation of the Earth’s core|date=2002-04-25|accessdate=2009-08-02|publisher=The Royal Society|author=D. Alfé|coauthors=M. J. Gillan, L. Vočadlo, J. Brodholt, G. D. Price|publisher=D. Alfé}}&lt;/ref&gt; The middle of the inside of the Earth would be liquid as well but all the weight of the rock above it pushes it back into being solid. This solid middle part (the &quot;[[inner core]]&quot;) is almost all [[iron]]. This is what makes the Earth [[magnetic field|magnetic]].

=== Pieces moving around ===
[[File:Plates tect2 en.svg|thumb|right|A [[map|picture]] showing the Earth's largest and most important plates.]]
{{main|Plate tectonics}}

The [[Earth's crust]] is solid but made of [[plate tectonics|parts]] which move very slowly.&lt;ref name=jour&gt;{{cite journal| last=Tackley | first=Paul J.| title=Mantle convection and plate tectonics: towards an integrated physical and chemical theory| journal=Science | date=2000-06-16| volume=288 | issue=5473 | pages=2002–2007| doi=10.1126/science.288.5473.2002| pmid=10856206 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The thin level of hard rock on the outside of the Earth rests on hot liquid material below it in the deeper [[mantle (geology)|mantle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TecPlates&quot; &gt;{{cite web|url=http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/education/vwlessons/lessons/Earths_layers/Earths_layers4.html|title=The Crust|accessdate=2009-07-03|publisher=Oregon State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; This liquid material moves because it gets heat from the hot center of the earth. The slow movement of the plates is what causes [[earthquake]]s, [[volcano]]es and large groups of mountains on the Earth.

There are three ways plates can come together. Two plates can move towards each other (&quot;convergent&quot; plate edges). This can form [[island]]s (such as [[Japan]]), [[volcano|burning mountain]]s, and high [[mountain range]]s (such as the [[Andes]] and [[Himalayas]]).&lt;ref name=book1&gt;{{cite book| last = Seyfert | first= Carl K. |title = The encyclopedia of structural geology and plate tectonics|year=1987|isbn=9780442281250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two plates can move away from each other (&quot;divergent&quot; plate edges). This gives the [[magma|warm liquid rock inside the earth]] a place to come out. This makes [[mid-ocean ridge|special mountain range]]s below the sea or large low lands like [[Africa]]'s [[Great Rift Valley]].&lt;ref name = 'platetectonics.com'&gt;{{cite web |title=Plate Tectonics: plate boundaries |url= http://www.platetectonics.com/book/page_5.asp |publisher=platetectonics.com |accessdate=12 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = 'usgs.understanding.com'&gt;{{cite web |title=Understanding plate motions |url= http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/understanding.html|publisher=USGS|accessdate=12 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plates are able to move beside each other as well (&quot;transform&quot; plate edges, such as the [[San Andreas Fault]]). This makes their edges crush against each other and makes many [[earthquakes|shocks as they move]].&lt;ref name=book2&gt;{{cite book|title=Plate tectonics: an insider's history of the modern theory of the Earth|isbn=9780813341329|last=Oreskes|fisrt=Naomi|publisher=Westview Press|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===What it's like outside===
The outside of the Earth is not even. There are high pointed places named [[mountain]]s and high flat places named [[plateau]]s; there are large low places called [[valley]]s and thin low places called [[canyon]]s. For the most part, moving [[wind|air]] and [[rain|water from the sky]] and [[tide|sea]]s [[erosion|damages rocks in high places and breaks them into small pieces]]; the air and water then move these pieces to lower places. The largest of these places are named [[plain]]s and are very important for [[agriculture|growing food]] and building great towns. Many persons live in the large plains of [[North China Plain|China]] and [[Ganges Plain|India]], for example. Because of this, the Earth would have all been very flat a long time before now, but the moving plates [[#Pieces moving around|discussed above]] make new high places before that is able to come about.

All of the high and low places on Earth are made of or are on top of rocks. The different kinds of these rocks was [[#What it's like inside|discussed above]]. The outside of the Earth is usually not uncovered rock, though. Over 70[[percent|%]] of the Earth is covered by [[ocean|sea]]s full of [[salt]]y water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Physical-Hydro&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/8a.html|title=CHAPTER 8: Introduction to the Hydrosphere|accessdate=2009-08-06|publisher=Physical Geography}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This salty water makes up about 97½[[percent|%]] of all Earth's water. The [[fresh water]] persons can drink is mostly [[ice]]. Only a very small amount is at hand in [[river]]s and under the earth for men and women to drink and use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espejo.unesco.org.uy/|title=WORLD WATER RESOURCES AND THEIR USES|accessdate=2009-08-06|publisher=UNESCO}}{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The air above the Earth stops the water from going away into [[outer space]]. As well, there have been so many living things for such a long time that much of the land on Earth is covered with plants or with what is left from earlier living things. Places with very little rain are dry wastes named [[desert]]s; these normally have very few living things but life is able to grow very quickly when these wastes have an uncommon rainfall. Places with large amounts of rain are almost always [[rain forest|large woods]]; these sometimes have so many trees that their leaves stop all the Sun's light from being able to get to the earth at all. Lately, [[person]]s have also changed the outside of the Earth a great amount ([[#Persons|see below]]).

===Air===
{{main|Atmosphere}}
All around the Earth is a large amount of air (the &quot;[[atmosphere]]&quot;). The mass of the Earth pulls the [[gas]]ses in the air down and does not let them go into outer space. The air is mostly made of [[nitrogen]] (about 78[[percent|%]]) and [[oxygen]] (about 21[[percent|%]]) but there are a few other gasses as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/9-12/features/912_liftoff_atm.html|title=NASA - Earth's atmosphere|accessdate=2009-08-06|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most living things need the air (or parts of the air gripped in the water) to breathe and live. They use the gasses&amp;mdash;specially [[oxygen]] and [[carbon dioxide]]&amp;mdash;to make and use [[sugar]] and to give themselves power.

The air animals and plants use to live is only the first level of the air around the Earth (the &quot;[[troposphere]]&quot;). The day to day changes in this level of air are named &quot;[[weather]]&quot;; the changes between places far away from each other and from year to year are named the &quot;[[climate]]&quot;. [[Rain]] and [[storm]]s are both in this level. Both come about because this part of the air gets colder as it goes up. [[convection|Cold air becomes thicker and falls, and warm air becomes thinner and goes up]].&lt;ref name = NASA&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/weather_worldbook.html|title= What causes weather?|accessdate=2009-08-06|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The turning Earth moves the air as well and air moves north and south because the middle of the Earth generally gets more power from the Sun and is warmer than the north and south points. At the same time, air over water (specially very warm water) [[evaporation|gets water in it]] but, because cold air is not able to take in as much water, it starts to make [[cloud]]s and [[rain]] as it gets colder. The way water moves around in a circle like this is called the &quot;[[water cycle]]&quot;.&lt;ref name= NASA /&gt;

Above this first level, there are four other levels. The air gets colder as it goes up in the first level; in the second level (the &quot;[[stratosphere]]&quot;), the air gets warmer as it goes up. This level has a special kind of [[oxygen]] named &quot;[[ozone]]&quot;. The [[ozone]] in this air keeps living things safe from [[ultraviolet radiation|damaging rays from the Sun]]. The power from these rays is what makes this level warmer and warmer. The middle level (the &quot;[[mesosphere]]&quot;) gets colder and colder with height; the fourth level (the &quot;[[thermosphere]]&quot;) gets warmer and warmer; and the last level (the &quot;[[exosphere]]&quot;) is almost outer space and has very little air at all. It reaches about half the way to the Moon. The three outer levels have a lot of [[electricity|electric power]] moving through them; this is called the &quot;[[ionosphere]]&quot; and is important for [[radio]] and other electric waves in the air. It is also where the [[Northern Lights]] are.

Even though air seems very light, the weight of all of the air above the outside of the Earth (&quot;[[air pressure]]&quot;) is important. Generally, from [[sea level]] to the top of [[exosphere|the outer level of the air]], a space of air one [[square centimeter]] across has a mass of about 1.03 [[kilogram|kg]] and a space of air one [[square inch]] across has a weight of about 14.7 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]]. The mass of the air also keeps the Earth safe when rocks (&quot;[[meteorite]]s&quot;) hit it from outer space. Without the air, the damage meteorites do would be much geater. Because of the air, meteorites generally burn up long before they get to the earth.

The air also keeps the Earth warm, specially the half turned away from the Sun. Some gasses &amp;ndash; especially [[methane]] and [[carbon dioxide]] &amp;ndash; [[greenhouse effect|work like a blanket to keep things warm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.physicalgeography.net/fundamentals/7h.html|title=Fundamentals of physical geography - the greenhouse effect|accessdate=2009-08-06|publisher=Physical Geography}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[#History|In the past]], the Earth has been much warmer and much colder than it is now. Since persons have grown used to the heat we have now, though, we do not want the Earth to be too much warmer or colder. Most of the ways men and women create [[electricity|electric power]] use burning kinds of [[carbon]]&amp;mdash;specially [[coal]], [[oil]], and [[natural gas]]. Burning these creates new [[carbon dioxide]] and can cause more warming. A [[climate change|large discussion]] is going on now about what men and women should do about [[global warming|the Earth's latest warming]], which has gone on for about 150 years. So far, this warming has been good for persons: plants have grown better and the weather has been better than [[Little Ice Age|when it was colder before]]. Some persons who learn about science, though, say that many bad things will possibly come about if the warming goes on.

==People==
{{main|Human}}
About 7 [[billion]] people live on Earth. They live in about 200 different lands called [[countries]]. Some (like [[Russia]]) are large with many large cities. Others (like [[the Vatican]]) are small. The five countries with the most people are [[China]], [[India]], the [[United States]], [[Indonesia]], and [[Brazil]]. About 90[[percent|%]] of people live in the [[northern hemisphere|north half]] of the world, which has most of the land. [[Scientist]]s think that people originally came from [[Africa]]. Now, 70[[percent|%]] of all people do not live in Africa but in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. 1997. ''[[Guns, Germs, and Steel]]: the fate of human societies''. New York: Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;

People change the Earth in many ways. They have been able to grow plants for food and clothes for about ten thousand years. When there was enough food, they were able to build towns and cities. Near these places, men and women were able to change rivers, [[irrigation|bring water to farms]], and stop [[flood]]s (rising water) from coming over their land. People found useful animals and [[domestication|bred]] them so they were easier to keep.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''experiment''' is a test of an [[idea]] or a [[method]]. It is often used by [[scientist]]s and [[engineer]]s.  An experiment is used to see how well the idea matches the real world.  Experiments have been used for many years to help people understand the world around them.

Experiments can tell us if a theory is false, or if something does not work. They cannot tell us if a theory is true. When [[Einstein]] said that [[gravity]] could affect [[light]], it took a few years before [[astronomers]] could test it. [[General relativity]] predicts that the path of light is bent in a [[gravitational field]]; light passing a massive body is deflected towards that body. This effect has been confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant [[quasar]]s being deflected as it passes the [[Sun]].&lt;ref&gt;Kennefick, Daniel 2005. Astronomers test general relativity: light-bending and the solar redshift. In Renn, Jürgen (ed) ''One hundred authors for Einstein''. Wiley-VCH, pp. 178–181. ISBN 3-527-40574-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro S.S. ''et al'' 2004. Measurement of the solar gravitational deflection of radio waves using geodetic very-long-baseline interferometry data, 1979–1999. ''Phys. Rev. Lett'. '''92''' (12): 121101. [http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v92/i12/e121101]&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, a hundred years or so after Einstein published his ideas, there have been many tests, all of which have been consistent with Einstein's predictions. But, one day, we might find the theory has some limits beyond which it does not work. Logically speaking, what we test are [[implication]]s of the theory, because the theory itself is too large and complicated to test all at once.

:&quot;The universe does not tell us when we are right, only when we are wrong&quot;. – [[Karl Popper]]

== Famous experiments ==
* [[Galileo Galilei]] did some experiments about [[free fall]] (1623)
* [[Benjamin Franklin]] showed that [[lightning]] is a form of [[electricity]] (1752)
* The [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] proved a flaw in old [[physics]], and prompted [[Einstein]]'s work (1887)
* [[Ivan Pavlov]] did some experiments about the [[classical conditioning]] of [[dog]]s (1927)
* The [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment]] proved DNA was the [[molecule]] which caused [[heredity]] (1944)
* [[Stanley Milgram]] showed that people follow orders; this became known as the [[Milgram experiment]] (1961)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ethics''' is the part of [[philosophy]] that deals with [[Goodness|good]] and [[evil]]. Ethics tries to answer questions like:

* What actions are good? What actions are evil?
* How can we tell the difference?
* Are good and evil the same for everyone?
* How should we make hard decisions that might help or hurt other people?
* How do our actions affect others?

== Ideas about ethics   ==
Some [[philosopher]]s call ethics the &quot;[[science]] of [[morality]]&quot;.
''Morality'' is what someone thinks or feels is good or bad.
There are many different moralities, but they share some things.
For example most people think that murder (killing somebody) is wrong.(compare [[Exodus]] 20:13)
Some philosophers have hope to find more things that moralities share.
They think that ethics should use the [[scientific method]] to study 
things that people think are good or bad. Their work can be used
to test the fairness of a situation, such as how people should treat
each other. An example of this kind of thinking is the [[categorical imperative]].
Many countries have laws based on this idea of fairness.

Other philosophers{{fact|date=December 2012}} think that ethics is separate from morality.
They do not think that ethics can be studied using the [[scientific method]] 
and they think it is closer to [[metaphysics]]. Some of them think like 
[[Platonism|platonists]] about what is good and bad.

Some philosophers {{fact|date=December 2012}} believe that ethics is [[subjectivism|subjective]].
This means that they think that what is right for me is whatever I say is right.
These philosophers do not think that ethics is the same for all people.

== What is ethics used for? ==
Understanding ethics can help people decide what to do when they have choices. Many philosophers think that doing anything or making any choice is a part of ethics.

Ethics is part of other fields of study in many ways. Here are some ways:

* Ethics is part of the study of [[religion]]. In religion, people often learn what is good or bad from what they believe about [[God]] (or gods). Some important ideas about what is good or bad have come from religion. See [[Ten Commandments]].

* Some theories of [[economics]] say ethics has to do with [[money]]. Money is a big part of most people's lives. Thinking about morality can be important in economics. For example, there is a saying about ethics taken from the [[Bible]] that 'the love of money is the root of all kinds of [[evil]]' (1 Timothy).The philosophy of [[Marxism]] also says that a few people using money in the wrong way can hurt many other people. 

* Government policy can be affected by what [[politics|politicians]] think is ethical. Politicians try to create [[laws]] that help everyone do what is right. Political debates happen when the people who make public policy do not agree about what is right.

* In work, thinking about ethics can help with hard questions. Work can be like both economics and politics. Workers have to make money and follow laws. But the best way to do both is not always easy to know. The study of this is called [[business ethics]]

* People like [[Medical doctor|doctors]] and [[nurse]]s have to make [[wikt:hard|hard]] choices about how to [[health care|care]] for people. Sometimes the person being cared for, their [[family]] or the doctor do not agree what is best for them. Also, choices have to be made if there is not enough money for all people to get the help they need. The study of this is called [[medical ethics]]

* Discussing ethics can also be a way to stop people fighting or starting a war. By talking about ethics, people hope to get what they want without being violent. This works when all people agree that peace is very important. But not everyone agrees about what is right or wrong. So, sometimes anger can make it hard to talk without fighting.

Along with [[aesthetics]] ethics forms part of [[axiology]] the philosophy of what people like.

* [[Utilitarianism]]
* ''[[The Republic]]'', a book by [[Plato]] that says that people who have power should use ethics to make choices.
* ''[[The Prince]]'', a book by [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] that says that people who have power should not use ethics to make choices.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''E Prime''' (it means '''English Prime''') is a way of speaking [[English language|English]] without using the verb [[to be|&quot;to be&quot;]] in any way (&quot;be, is, am, are, was, were, been, and being&quot;). Instead, an E Prime speaker or writer uses different verbs like &quot;to become,&quot; &quot;to remain,&quot; and &quot;to equal&quot; or they might choose to rearrange the sentence to show that the &quot;thing&quot; does not actually &quot;act&quot;. For example, in E Prime, a writer would change the statement &quot;Mistakes were made&quot; to &quot;Joe made mistakes.&quot; This change in wording reveals an actor (Joe) where the previous form concealed the actor. Users of E Prime would consider the changed sentence more accurate.

== What E Prime is ==
D. David Bourland, Jr. first suggested E Prime in 1965. Bourland had studied the discipline (way of thinking) of [[General semantics|General Semantics]]. The main idea of General Semantics is that people can only know what they observe and experience when they see, hear, touch, taste, smell, think, and feel, and furthermore, that what they observe and experience can affect how they observe and experience in the future. Because each person has different experiences throughout their lives, they interpret their experiences differently. 

Students of General Semantics and users of E Prime contend that to say &quot;This cat '''is''' soft&quot; leaves out many other attributes, and implies that the outside &quot;object&quot; of the cat is the &quot;same as&quot; the inside experience of &quot;softness&quot;. Instead, E Prime users say &quot;This cat '''feels''' soft TO ME&quot; to remind themselves of the following:
#That their experience of &quot;softness&quot; involves both the outside &quot;object&quot; called &quot;cat&quot; and the eyes, hands, brain and [[nervous system]] of the observer.
# That someone else might experience different aspects of the cat.
# That they themselves might experience something different at a different time or in different circumstances. (The cat might scratch them, or look or feel wet or matted with dirt.)

== What E Prime is not ==
Although languages like [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], and [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] do not always use a separate verb for &quot;to be,&quot; they do have the idea of &quot;being.&quot; For example, an English speaker might say &quot;This apple is red.&quot; An Arabic speaker might say &quot;This apple red.&quot; Most languages can be used to express the idea of a red apple. An E Prime user chooses to only say that &quot;This apple looks red to me&quot; to remind themselves that &quot;seeing red&quot; involves both the apple and the eye and brain of the person looking at the apple.

Many teachers of English encourage students to use verbs other than &quot;to be.&quot; To them, using more active verbs makes writing clearer and more interesting. These teachers want to improve their students' writing and may not agree with the ideas of General Semantics or E Prime.

==Different functions of 'to be'==
In English, 'to be' can have different functions:
#It talks about [[Identity (philosophy)|Identity]]: ''The cat is my only pet'', ''The cat is Garfield''
#It talks about belonging to a class, or a group: ''The cat is an animal''
#It can talk about properties: ''The cat is furry''
#It can be an [[auxiliary verb]]: ''The cat is sleeping'', ''The cat is bitten by the dog''
#It can talk about [[existence]]: ''There is a cat''
#It can talk about [[Location (geography)|location]]: ''The cat is here''

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''''Einstein on the Beach''''' is an [[opera]] written by the [[minimalist]] [[composer]] [[Philip Glass]] and theater director and designer [[Robert Wilson]]. It was first acted for an audience in [[Avignon]], [[France]] in 1976. 

It is a single act opera, about five hours long with no [[intermission]]. Because of the length and the minimalist ([[repetition|repetitive]]) nature of the music, audience members are free to enter and leave the opera as they wish. Glass's music tends to cycle round, but does not exactly repeat itself. Admittedly, he has described himself as a composer of &quot;music with repetitive structures&quot;.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.philipglass.com/bio.php |periodical=PhilipGlass.com |title=Biography |accessdate=November 10, 2008 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though his earlier music fits what is normally called &quot;minimalist&quot;, he has since evolved stylistically.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/music/pop/reviews/485/ |title=Is Glass half empty? |periodical=New York Magazine |first=Ethan |last=Smith |accessdate=November 10, 2008 |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=appomattox&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/23/arts/music/23smit.html |periodical=[[The New York Times]] |title=If Grant had been singing at Appomattox |date=September 23, 2007 |first=Steve |last=Smith |postscript=&lt;!--none--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''ethnic group''' is a group of people who are considered to be the same in some or multiple ways. They may all have the same [[ancestor]]s, speak the same [[language]], or have the same [[religion]]. They often live in the same or surrounding area.  

Sometimes almost all of the people in one [[country]] are of the same ethnic group, but not always. Often one country may have several different ethnic groups, or the people of one ethnic group may live in several different countries.

The [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] ensures the rights of ethnic groups in Article 27 and also gives them the right to use their own language.

'''Ebola virus''' is a very dangerous [[virus]]. It causes a ''hemorrhagic fever'' called '''Ebola virus disease'''. &quot;Hemorrhagic&quot; means that the victim will bleed a lot, inside and outside their body. Out of every 10 people who get Ebola, on average five to nine die. There are four kinds of Ebola virus that can cause the disease. The virus was first found in [[Sudan]]. It is found in [[Africa]], with very few cases in [[Europe]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/2/12-0524_article|title=Ebola virus antibodies in fruit bats, Bangladesh|publisher=CDC|year=2013|journal=Emerging Infectious Disease|volume=19|issue=2|authors=Kevin J. Olival ''et al'' |doi=10.3201/eid1902.120524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transmission ==
The Ebola virus that makes people sick lives in the [[blood]] and other liquids and wet things in some kinds of animals without killing them. Scientists think the animals it lives in are mainly some kinds of monkeys or [[fruit bat]]s. When people touch animals that have the virus, or wet things that came out of those animals, or [[liquid|liquids]] like water that those animals touched, they can get sick.&lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; 

Ebola cannot be caught through the air, or by being near sick people.&lt;ref name=&quot;WHOAir2014&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=2014 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa|url=http://www.who.int/ith/updates/20140421/en/|website=WHO|accessdate=3 August 2014|date=April 21 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The virus can only go from [[liquid|liquids]] into people's bodies. This means Ebola can be caught by touching a sick person's [[blood]], [[saliva]], [[mucus]], [[semen]], [[diarrhea]], [[vomit]], or other fluids that come out of a sick person's body. It can also be caught by touching water that has been touched by sick people.&lt;ref name=WHO2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Ebola virus disease  Fact sheet N°103|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/|work=World Health Organization|accessdate=12 April 2014|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a person does not die from the disease, he can still give other people the infection by having [[sex]] for nearly another two months after they stop being sick. This is because the virus can still be in the man's [[semen]] a long time.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=WHO2014/&gt; --&gt;

== Symptoms ==
When people get Ebola the first [[symptom]]s look like some other diseases. People get a [[fever]] and feel very tired. Their [[headache|head]], [[stomach]], [[joint|joints]], and [[throat]] might hurt. Sometimes, people think they have other diseases like [[malaria]] or [[typhoid fever]].

Later, people get much sicker. They bleed both inside and outside their bodies. They have [[blood]] in their [[diarrhea]] and [[vomit]]. They bleed from their [[nose]]s, [[mouth]]s, and [[genital]]s/sex organs. They get [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]]: low [[blood pressure]], fast pulse ([[heart]] rate), and low [[circulatory system|blood circulation]] to the body. Their [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] might stop working, which can lead to impaired kidneys or liver. Ebola also causes stiffness throughout the body which makes it hard for sick people to move. 

Five to nine out of every ten people who get sick with Ebola die.

== Treatment ==
There is no cure for Ebola, but if people get care quickly from [[Medical doctor|doctors]] and [[nurse]]s at a [[hospital]], more of them live. People with Ebola need a lot of fluids to replace fluids lost from [[diarrhea]], [[vomiting]], and bleeding. The most important care is giving them water with a very small amount of salt and sugar in it. This is called [[oral rehydration therapy|oral rehydration]]. It helps to replace their fluids and blood. It is also important to give medicines in case they get bad [[blood pressure]] and blood circulation.

== Prevention ==
Scientists have not yet found a vaccine for Ebola, but efforts are underway. However, it is a treatable disease. There are survivors of Ebola living in the US to this day.

[[File:Ecologia.jpg|thumb|250px|]]
'''Ecology''' is the [[science]] which studies the [[biota]] and the [[environment]], and their interactions. It comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''oikos'' = house; ''logos'' = study. Ecology is the study of [[ecosystem]]s. Ecosystems describe the web or network of relations among organisms at different scales of organization. Since ecology refers to any form of [[biodiversity]], ecologists research everything from tiny [[bacteria]] in [[nutrient]] [[recycling]] to the effects of [[tropical]] [[rain forest]]s on the Earth's atmosphere.  Scientists who study these interactions are called ''ecologists''. 

[[Terrestrial ecoregion]] and [[climate change]] research are two areas where ecologists (people studying ecology) now focus.

There are many practical applications of ecology in [[conservation]] biology, [[wetland]] management, [[natural resource]] management ([[agriculture]], [[forestry]], [[fishing|fisheries]]), city [[planning]] (urban ecology), [[community health]], [[economics]], and applied science. It provides a framework for understanding and researching human social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Omerod S.J. Pienkowski M.W. &amp; Watkinson A.R. 1999. Communicating the value of ecology. ''Journal of Applied Ecology'' '''36''', 847–855&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Phillipson J. Lowe P. &amp; Bullock J.M. 2009. Navigating the social sciences: interdisciplinarity and ecology.

''BioScience'' '''58''' 139–150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aguirre09&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Aguirre | first=A.A. | title=Biodiversity and Human Health | journal=EcoHealth | year=2009 | doi=10.1007/s10393-009-0242-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;


== Ecology in politics ==
Ecology starts many powerful philosophical and political movements - including the conservation movement, wellness movement, environmental movement, and ecology movement we know today. When these are combined with [[peace]] movements and the Six Principles, they are called [[green]] movements. In general, these put [[ecosystem health]] first on a list of human moral and political priorities, as the way to achieve better human health and social harmony, and better [[economics]]. 

People with these beliefs are called political ecologists. Some have organized into the Green Parties, but there are actually political ecologists in most political parties. They very often use arguments from ecology to advance [[policy]], especially [[forest]] policy and energy [[policy]].

Also, ecology means that it is the branch of biology dealing with the relations and interactions between organisms and their environment, including other organisms.

== Ecology includes economics ==
Many ecologists also deal with human economics:

* [[Lynn Margulis]] says that economics studies how humans make a living, while ecology studies how every other animal makes a living.
* [[Mike Nickerson]] says that &quot;economy is three-fifths of ecology&quot;, since ecosystems create resources and dispose of waste, which the economy assumes is done &quot;for free&quot;.

Ecological [[economic]]s and human development theory try to separate the economic questions from others, but it is difficult. Many people think economics is just part of ecology now, and that economics that ignores it is wrong. &quot;Natural [[capital (economics)|capital]]&quot; is an example of one [[theory]] combining both.

== Ecology mirrors anthropology ==
Sometimes ecology is compared to [[anthropology]], because both use a lot of methods to study one thing we cannot live without. Anthropology is about how our bodies and minds are affected by our environment, while ecology is about how our [[environment]] is affected by our bodies and minds. There is even a type of anthropology called ecological anthropology, which studies how people interact with the environment. 

Antoine de Saint-Exupery stated: &quot;The earth teaches us more about ourselves than all the books. Because it resists us. Man discovers himself when he measures himself against the obstacle.&quot;

'''Economics''' is the [[social science]] which studies economic activity: how people make [[choice]]s to get what they [[want]]. It has been defined as &quot;the study of scarcity and choice&quot; and is basically about individual choice. It also studies what affects the production, distribution and consumption of goods and [[service (economics)|services]] in an economy.

Investing and [[income]] relates to economics.&lt;ref&gt;Krugman, Paul; Robin Wells (2012) ''Microeconomics: Second Edition in Modules'' Worth Publishers page 2&lt;/ref&gt; The word comes from [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]], and relates to οἶκος oíkos &quot;house&quot; and νόμος nomos &quot;custom&quot; or &quot;law&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;etymology&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Harper | first = Douglas | authorlink = Douglas Harper | title = Online Etymology Dictionary&amp;nbsp;— Economy | date = November 2001 | url = http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=economy | accessdate=October 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scientific model|model]]s used in economics today were mostly started in the 19th century. People took ideas from the field of [[political economy]] because they wanted to use an [[empiricism|empirical]] approach similar to the one used in the [[natural sciences]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot;&gt;Clark, B. (1998). ''Political-economy: A comparative approach''. Westport, CT: Preager.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subjects and objects in economics ==
The subjects in economic study are households, business companies, the government (the state), and foreign countries. '''Households''' offer their &quot;[[factors of production]]&quot; to companies. This includes work, land, [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (machines, buildings) and information. They get income which they use to buy or 'consume' goods. 

'''Business companies''' produce and sell [[Good (economics)|goods]] and buy factors of production from households and from other companies. 

'''The state''' or [[public sector]] includes institutions and organisations. The state takes some of the earnings from the business companies and households, and uses it to pay for &quot;public goods&quot; like [[street]]s or [[education]], to be available for everyone. The last subject is '''foreign countries''' this includes all households, business companies and state institutions, which are not based in one's own country. They demand and supply goods from abroad.

The objects in economic study are consumer goods, capital goods, and factors of production. Consumer goods are classified as &quot;usage goods&quot; (for example, gasoline or toilet paper), as &quot;purpose goods&quot; (for example, a house or bicycle), and as &quot;services&quot; (for example, the work of a doctor or cleaning lady). Capital goods are goods which are necessary for producing other goods. Examples of these are buildings, equipment, and machines. Factors of production are work, ground, capital, information, and environment.

== General economic rules ==
* All people have to decide between their options.
* The cost of a goods is what a person gives up for the goods.
* When a person gives up something (like money) to get a good, he also gives up other things that he could have gotten instead.  The true cost of something is what you give up to get it.  This includes [[money]], and the economic benefits (utility) that you didn't get because you bought or did that thing and can no longer buy or do something else.  This is called [[opportunity cost]].
* People react to incentives. Making an option more attractive will make more people choose it.
* Markets are usually good for the organisation of economic life. In the [[free market]], goods will be shared by people and companies making small decisions. The “invisible hand” of the market ([[Adam Smith]]) states that if everyone tries to get what they want, everyone will be as well-off as they could possibly be.
* Sometimes prices do not fully show the cost or benefit to society. For example, [[air pollution]] is bad for society, and education is good for society. The government can put a tax (or do something to reduce sales) on items that are bad for society. It can also support (like giving money for) items that are good for society.
* The living standard of a country depends on the skills to produce services and goods. Productivity is the amount of the produced goods divided by total working hours. 
* When there is an increase in the total money supply, or when the cost to produce things rise, prices go up. This is called [[inflation]].

== History ==
* [[18th century]] analysis of [[wealth]]
** [[Physiocracy]]
* [[classical economics]]
* [[Marxist economics]]
* [[Austrian economics]]
* [[neoclassical economics]]
* [[welfare economics]]

Economists are strongly influenced by the times they live in.  For example, [[Karl Marx]] lived in a time where [[worker]]s' conditions were very poor, and [[John Maynard Keynes]] lived through the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s. Today's economists can look back and understand why they made their judgements, and try to make better ones.

== Branches of economics ==
The two main branches of economics are [[microeconomics]] and [[macroeconomics]].  

Macroeconomics is about the economy in general.  For example, if a country's wealth goes up or if millions of people become unemployed, those are things that macroeconomists study.  Microeconomics is about smaller and more specific things such as how families and households spend their money.

There are a number of other branches of economics:
* [[behavioral economics]]
* business economics
* [[Constitutional economics]]
* [[development economics]]
* [[ecological economics]]
* [[economic geography]]
* [[environmental economics]]
* [[energy economics]]
* [[financial economics]]
* industrial economics
* [[information economics]]
* [[international economics]]
* [[labor economics]]
* [[managerial economics]]
* mathematical economics or econometrics
* [[resource economics]]
* [[urban economics]]
* [[public economics]]
* descriptive, theoretical and policy economics
* monetary economics

== Famous economists ==

Famous economists in history include:
* [[Adam Smith]] (considered to be the father of economics; he supported [[free market]]s).
* [[Thomas Malthus]] (he wrote about how a high population can affect the economy badly).
* [[Karl Marx]] (he wrote a book called [[The Communist Manifesto]]; he supported [[communism]]).
* [[John Maynard Keynes]] (he created a popular economic theory called [[Keynesian economics]]).
* [[Milton Friedman]] (he wrote a lot about [[monetarism]] and the [[money supply]]).

Famous economists of the 19th and 20th century include [[Léon Walras]], [[Carl Menger]], [[N. Gregory Mankiw]] and [[Friedrich August von Hayek]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Sulfur.jpg|thumb|The element [[Sulphur]] has a [[crystal|crystalline]] structure]]
[[File:Brom amp.jpg|thumb|[[Bromine]] is one of only two elements that are liquid, at 25°C. The other is [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]&lt;ref name=ryan /&gt;]]
A '''chemical element''' is a [[substance]] that contains only one type of [[atom]]. An element is the smallest amount of a substance that can still keep its properties. If a substance contains more than one type of atom, it is a [[chemical compound|compound]]. An element can be a solid, liquid or gas. The smallest [[particle]] of such an element is an [[atom]]. Atoms are made up of [[protons]], [[neutron]]s, and [[electron]]s. 

Each element contains only one kind of atom.&lt;ref name=brand /&gt; The number of protons in an atom controls the atom's properties.  This number is called the [[atomic number]]. For example, all atoms with 6 protons are of the chemical element [[carbon]], and all atoms with 92 protons are of the element [[uranium]]. 

Elements are the basic building blocks for all types of substances. When they are combined with each other, they can form [[molecules]]. 

118 different chemical elements are known to modern [[chemistry]]. 92 of these elements can be found in [[nature]]&lt;ref name=ryan&gt;{{cite book|author=Ryan, Lawrie|title=Chemistry for You: National Curriculum Edition for GCSE|edition=2|publisher=Nelson Thornes|isbn=9780748762347|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the others can only be made in [[laboratory|laboratories]]. The human body is made up of 26 elements.&lt;ref name=ryan /&gt; The last natural element discovered was uranium, in 1789.&lt;ref name=&quot;sl2&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Devlin|first=Jacinta|coauthors=Cochrane, Helen|others=Coffey, Rhonda|title=Science Links 2 |publisher=Heinemann|date=2005|edition=VELS Edition|pages=5|chapter=1|isbn=I740815203|accessdate=16 December 2009|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ce.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chemicalelements.com/elements/u.html|title=Periodic Table: Uranium|publisher=Chemical Elements.com|accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first man-made element was [[Technetium]], in 1937. 

Chemical elements are commonly arranged in the [[periodic table]]. Where the elements are on the table tells us about their properties relative to the other elements.

==Chemical symbols==
Chemical elements are also given a unique ''chemical symbol''. Chemical symbols are used all over the world. This means that, no matter which language is spoken, there is no confusion about what the symbol means.&lt;ref name=BBC /&gt; Chemical symbols of elements come from their English or Latin names. For example, [[carbon]] has the chemical symbol 'C', and [[sodium]] has chemical symbol 'Na', after the Latin ''natrium''. [[Tungsten]] is called 'W' after its German name, ''[[wolfram]]''.&lt;ref name=sl2/&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/ks3bitesize/science/chemical_material_behaviour/atoms_elements/revise3.shtml|title=BBC Bitesize: Science: Chemical and material behaviour: Atoms and elements: Chemical symbols|page=3|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Au' is the symbol for gold and it comes from the Latin word for gold, ''aurum''.&lt;ref name=brand&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brand, Ian|author2=Grime, Richard|title=Longman Chemistry 11-14|date=2002|publisher=Pearson Education|isbn=9780582447554}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cd&gt;{{cite book|author=Kidd, D. A.|title=Collins Pocket Latin Dictionary|publisher=Collins|date=2008|isbn=9780007263745}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another symbol which comes from Latin is 'Ag'. This is the element [[Silver|silver]] and it comes from the Latin ''argentum''.&lt;ref name=cd /&gt; [[Lead]]'s symbol, 'Pb', comes from the Latin ''plumbum''&lt;ref name=cd /&gt; and the English word [[Plumbing|plumber]] derives from this as pipes used to be made out of lead.&lt;ref name=ryan /&gt; Others were named after famous people, like [[einsteinium]], which was named after [[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref name=sl2/&gt;

==Compounds==
Elements can join (react) to form pure [[Chemical compound|compounds]] (such as [[water]], [[salt]]s, [[oxide]]s, and [[organic compound]]s). In many cases, these compounds have a fixed composition and their own [[structure]] and [[property|properties]]. The properties of the compound may be very different from the elements it is made from. [[Sodium]] is a [[metal]] that burns when put into water and [[chlorine]] is a poisonous gas. When they react together they make ''sodium chloride'' ([[salt]]) which is harmless and edible.

==Mixtures==
Some elements, particularly metal elements mix together in any [[proportion]] to form new structures. Such new structures are not compounds. They are called [[mixture]]s.

==Isotopes==
Most elements in nature consist of atoms with different numbers of neutrons.&lt;ref name=salters&gt;{{cite book|page=17|editor1=Otter, Chris|editor2=Stephenson, Kay|title=Salters Advanced Chemistry: Chemical Ideas|publisher=Heinemann|date=2008|edition=Third|isbn=978-0-435631-49-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[isotope]] is a form of an element with a certain number of neutrons. For example, carbon has two stable, naturally occurring isotopes: [[carbon-12]] (6 neutrons) and [[carbon-13]] (7 neutrons). [[Carbon-14]] (8 neutrons) is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of carbon.

== Classification ==
Elements can be classified based on [[States of matter|physical states]]. At room temperature and pressure, most elements are [[solid]]s, only 11 are [[gas]]es and 2 are [[liquid]]s.

Elements can also be classified into [[metal]]s and [[non-metal]]s. There are many more metals than non-metals. 

However, a few elements have properties in between those of metals and non-metals. These elements are called [[semimetal]]s (or metalloids).

==Geography==
Egypt is a large country, but a large portion of it is [[desert]]. Most people live in areas around the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and along the [[Nile]] River.

[[File:Giza Plateau - Pyramid of Menkaure.JPG|thumb|Pyramid of Menkaure|236x236px]]
Tourism is one of the most important national incomes in Egypt. In 2008, about 12 million tourists visited Egypt providing nearly 12$ billion of national income to Egypt. Tourism is very related to the economy of the country as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/10/20/ozabs-tourism-egypt-idAFJOE59J0PG20091020?sp=true &quot;Egypt tourism numbers to fall less than feared&quot;], Reuters Africa. (2009-10-20)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giza Necropolis]] is one of Egypt's iconic sites. It's a very popular destination for tourists to visit. It's very popularized for its containment of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] which is considered one of the [[Seven Wonders of the World]].

Many tourists love to visit Egypt for its historical, cultural, religious and entertainment experience of tourism.

== Transport ==
There are many transport ways in Egypt along the Nile.

=== Metro ===
[[File:Cairo Metro Sadat plathome.jpg|thumb|238x238px|Cairo Metro, Sadat Station]]
[[Cairo Metro]] is one of the most important projects in Egypt. It consists of 3 lines. Metro is the most preferable transport in Egypt due to persistent major traffic jams in the streets of Cairo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/04/world/middleeast/cairos-subway-is-efficient-orderly-and-dependable.html &quot;Underground, Everything That Life Above Is Not&quot;], NY Times.

''Retrieved 8 Oct 2012''&lt;/ref&gt;

A Metro line 4 is right now being developed and expected to be active in future reaching New Cairo District.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/cairo-metro/ &quot;Cairo Metro, Egypt&quot;], Railway Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ecological yield''' is the harvestable [[growth]] of an [[ecosystem]].  It is most commonly measured in [[forestry]] - in fact [[sustainable forestry]] is defined as that which does not harvest more wood in a year than has grown in that year, within a given patch of forest.

However, the concept is also applicable to [[water]], and [[soil]], and any other aspect of an ecosystem which can be both harvested and renewed - the so-called [[renewable resource]]s.  The [[carrying capacity]] of an ecosystem is reduced over time if more than the amount which is &quot;renewed&quot; (refreshed or regrown or rebuilt).

The '''experience economy''' is the [[wikt:intangible|intangible]] [[service economy]] that customers experience directly.  In [[moral purchasing]], [[Natural Capitalism]] and other theories of how consumers make choices, they are actually choosing experiences or [[comprehensive outcome]]s of their choices.  For instance to [[buy local]] is to choose a whole experience of local suppliers, such as in a [[farmers market]] or [[Slow Food]], that is quite different than the experience associated with [[factory food]] or [[fast food]].

'''Execution''' is where [[state]] authorities [[kill]] someone for having committed an extremely serious [[crime]], usually [[treason]] or especially terrible [[murder]]s. In most [[country|countries]] where the [[death penalty]] is still provided for by [[law]], using it is an option available to the sentencing [[judge]]: even if the jury or judicial panel recommends the death penalty, the presiding judge still has the option to lock the convicted person in a [[prison]] for the rest of their life.
[[Image:DelarocheLadyJaneGrey.jpg|thumb|[[Lady Jane Grey]], a probably innocent Queen of England is beheaded.]]

==Beheading==

Beheading means cutting the convict's head off. It is one of the oldest execution methods and already mentioned in the [[Bible]]. Beheading used to be the standard method of execution in Scandinavia and Germany. Commoners were usually beheaded with an [[axe]] and noblemen with a [[sword]]. A special device, like [[guillotine]], can also be used, as in France. [[Nazi Germany]] used guillotine to execute criminal convicts, such as murderers.

Centuries ago many countries used beheading as an execution for important people, including England. In England, many noblemen and even some kings and queens have been beheaded. There, the prisoner would be led up the scaffold and usually say a speech. Then, he/she would be blindfolded and put his/her neck onto a block. Then, the executioner would lift up his axe and swing it down onto the victim's neck. If the executioner was skilled and the axe was sharp, then the axe would usually cut through the bone and organs of the victim in one stroke. But if the executioner was inexperienced, then it may take many strokes before the head would be cut off.

==Other ways of execution==
Many countries do not allow executions as punishment any more, because it is too violent.  However, many states of the [[United States]] and some other foreign countries allow it.  Even in the United States, less violent ways of execution have had to be used.  Here are some other ways of execution other than hanging

*'''[[Lethal injection]]''':  Killing a person by placing several poisons in their blood.  This is used as the choice of execution in most U.S. states that allow executions
*'''[[Gas chamber]]''': A person is placed in area where the air is filled with bad gases until he cannot breathe and dies.  This was used as an execution method in some U.S. states, and by the Nazis during the Holocaust.
*'''Electrocution''': Killing a person by placing them in an [[electric chair]] and giving them a very high electric shock.
*'''Firing Squad''':  Several people (some who do not have real bullets) shoot and kill a person.  This execution was used in the state of [[Utah]] until recently, and was also often used in the United States [[Army]]. This method has been popular amongst the armies around the world, since guns and bullets are readily available. Firing squad was the lawful means of execution in [[Finland]] until 1944, when death penalty was abolished (stopped by the law).

== Old-fashioned methods ==
*'''[[Garrote|Garroting]]''', a method of strangulation used in [[Spain]] for hundreds of years.
*'''Crushing''', also called '''pressing''': used in the [[common law]] legal systems. A [[defendant]] who refused to plead (&quot;stood mute&quot;) would be subjected to having heavier and heavier [[stone]]s placed upon his or her [[chest]] until a plea was entered or the person [[Suffocation|suffocated]].
*'''Hanging''': Using a rope to either break the convict's neck or to choke (strangulate) him.  Widely used around the world until the 20th century. Still today in use in some countries, such as [[Iraq]], [[Singapore]] and [[Japan]].
*'''Drawing and Quartering''':  A very violent form of execution common in Medieval and Renaissance Europe. It involved taking a person's organs out while he was still alive, then tying him to four horses going in different directions until his body is torn apart.  A similar thing is &quot;breaking on the wheel&quot;, when a wheel rather than horses is used to tear a person's body apart
*'''Cruxifixion''': This method means literally nailing the convict on a [[cross]]. It is considered as the most painful and nasty method of all. It was used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] to punish traitors, rebels and runaway slaves. Death by this method may take days. The convict dies from blood loss, slow choking, loss of water and fever caused by muscle cramps. Besides the Roman and Persian Empires, this method was also used in feudal Japan.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Flesch Reading Ease''' measures [[textual difficulty]], which indicates how easy a text is to [[read]].

Tools to calculate the Flesch Reading Ease include:

* [[Microsoft Word]]'s [[grammar]] check
* [[Abiword]] (open source)
* [[Koffice|KWord]] (open source)

==How it works==

The Flesch Reading Ease Scale measures readability as follows: 

100: Very easy to read. [[Average]] [[sentence]] length is 12 [[word|words]] or fewer. No words of more than two [[syllable|syllables]]. 

65: Plain English. Average sentence is 15 to 20 words long. Average word has two syllables. 

30: A little hard to read. Sentences will have mostly 25 words. Two syllables usually.

0: Very hard to read. Average sentence is 37 words long. Average word has more than two syllables. 

The higher the [[rating]], the easier the text is to understand. By the very nature of technical subject matter, the Flesch score is
usually relatively low for technical documentation. If the Flesch test is used regularly, one may develop a sense of what a
reasonable score is for the type of documentation one is working on and aim to align with this score. The approach to calculating
the Flesch score is as follows: 

# Calculate the average sentence length, L. 
# Calculate the average number of syllables per word, N. 
# Calculate score (between 0-100%).

'''February''' is the second [[month]] of the [[year]], coming between [[January]] and [[March]], with 28 days in most years. In [[leap year]]s February has 29 days. In [[Sweden]] in [[1732]] the month had 30 days. This was to make the calendar match the rest of the world. In [[1930]] and [[1931]], February had 30 days in the [[Soviet Union]] because the government changed all the months to be 30 days long. The name comes either from the Roman god Februus or else from &quot;februa&quot;, the festivals of purification celebrated in Rome every fifteenth of this month.

== The Month ==
[[File:Valentines Day Chocolates from 2005.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Chocolates for [[Valentine's Day]], [[February 14]].]]
February is one of the last two months to be added to the calendar at the beginning of the year (the other is January). This is because in the original [[Roman calendar]], the two months of [[winter]], when not much would happen in agriculture, did not have names.

February is the second month of the year, coming between [[January]] and [[March]], and is also the shortest month, with 28 days in a [[common year]], and 29 days in a [[leap year]]. February begins on the same day of the week as [[March]] and [[November]] in [[common year]]s, and on the same day as [[August]] in a [[leap year]]. Every year, February ends on the same day of the week as [[October]], and in common years, February also ends on the same day of the week as [[January]]. In a [[leap year]], February is the only month to begin and end on the same day of the week.

From circa 700 BC, when Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, added it to the calendar, February had 23 days and 24 days on some of every second year, until 46 BC when Julius Caesar assigned it 29 days on every fourth year and 28 days otherwise. [[Leap year]] Day, [[February 29]], is added in every year that can be divided equally by four, such as [[2012]] and [[2016]], but this does not apply when the year ending in &quot;00&quot; at the turn of the [[century]] does not divide equally into 400. This means that [[2000]] was a [[leap year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], but [[1900]] was not. This is where the [[Julian calendar]] calculated dates differently, as it always repeated [[February 29]] every four years.

February is a [[winter]] month in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and a [[summer]] month in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. In each [[hemisphere]], it is the [[season]]al equivalent of [[August]] in the other. In [[weather]] [[lore]], [[Groundhog Day]], in the [[United States]], is set to decide what the weather will be like for the rest of the [[winter]].

February's flower is the [[violet (plant)|violet]] and its [[birthstone]] is the [[amethyst]]. The meaning of the amethyst is sincerity. The [[zodiac]] signs for February are [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]] ([[January 21]] to [[February 19]]), and [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]] ([[February 20]] to [[March 20]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Financial capital''' is a form of [[capital (economics)|capital]]. It is things that have [[value]], but do not do anything by themselves. They are only valuable because people value (want) them. For example, [[money]] is a form of financial capital. You cannot do anything with money but it still has value.

Financial capital is used to pay for things, this is because there is always more of it and people always want it. This means that financial capital has a stable value and can be traded in most places and with most people.

Some forms of financial capital, such as [[stock]]s, [[gold]] or [[bond (finance)|bond]]s are not wanted by everybody. However they can be traded with people for money or another type of financial capital. Because of this, these forms of financial capital do not have a stable price. This means that some people try to make a [[profit]] by buying and selling these types of financial capital in a [[market]].

Some things are treated as financial capital, even though they do have a use. For example, some people buy and sell [[land]] but are not interested in doing anything with it. Some people think this sort of trade is bad because the land should be used and not just treated like money. Other types of capital, such as [[social capital]] and [[human capital]] are rarely treated like financial capital. This may be because they involve people. Treating useful capital like financial capital is called [[comodification]].

In [[politics]], a common question is how often the government should use financial capital. In particular, should the government use financial capital to make a profit? Traditionally, [[liberal]] [[politicians]] do not mind this kind of trading for profit, but [[socialist]] or [[conservatism|conservative]] politicians are against it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:LeeSmolinAtHarvard.JPG|thumb|Lee Smolin, creator of the Fecund universes theory]]
'''Fecund universes''' is a [[multiverse]] [[theory]] of [[Lee Smolin]].  It relies on [[models of our universe]] and [[statistics]] from [[astrophysics]] but is more correctly a theory of [[cosmology]].

In this theory, collapsing stars, or [[black hole]]s, are always [[creating]] new universes with slightly different [[laws of physics]].  Because these laws are only slightly different, each is assumed to be like a [[mutation]] of the original universe, as if each universe was a kind of [[single-celled organism]].  It would [[reproduce]] by &quot;splitting&quot; in some sense.

This theory relies on many [[models of our universe]] to model these &quot;mutated&quot; alternative universes, the ones that Smolin supposes are generated or &quot;spun off&quot; by [[black hole]]s. 

No [[human]] can ever be part of any of these &quot;other&quot; universes.  Observations from [[astrophysics]] can only say if the black holes exist or are common, and give some idea of how much the [[laws of physics]] can vary and still let the new universes produce new black holes.  

Smolin predicts that there would be many black holes in the universe humans can see, since they are likely in a very late born universe, by simple probability.  If there are many black holes, that is evidence for his theory, 

As this shows, [[cosmology]] has a very different [[standard of evidence]] and [[burden of proof]] than is required for [[models of our universe]] only, which humans (using mathematics) can observe and exchange [[knowledge]] on.

It is hard to separate science from [[religion]] on such questions.  It may be a simple matter of preference whether one wants to see one's universe as part of a system like [[biology]] or like [[mechanics]] - [[clockwork]].  Smolin's theory is important mostly because it challenges the [[mechanistic paradigm]].  

Even if it is wrong, it raises the idea that living beings might have to see their universe as also living to be able to understand or care about it at all.  Some compare Smolin's theory to [[Gaia philosophy]] which combines [[biology]], [[geology]] and [[ecology]] to explain the [[Earth]], our planet, as a living thing.  If both are right, humans are on a living planet in a living universe.  This idea is very appealing - which does not mean it is really &quot;right&quot;.  Some think both are a kind of [[religion]].

'''Food''' is material that comes from [[animal]]s or [[plant]]s. It is eaten by living things to provide [[energy]] and [[nutrition]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212568/food Definition&lt;/ref&gt; Food contains the [[nutrition]] that people and animals need to be healthy. It contains [[protein]], [[fat]], [[carbohydrate]]s, [[vitamin]]s, and [[Dietary mineral|minerals]]. Liquids used for energy and nutrition are often called &quot;[[drink]]s&quot;.

Food for humans is mostly made through [[farming]] or [[gardening]]. It includes animal and vegetable sources. Some people refuse to eat food from animal origin, like meat, eggs, and products with milk in them. Not eating meat is called [[vegetarianism]]. Not eating or using any animal products is called [[veganism]].

Food produced by farmers or gardeners can be changed by industrial processes (the [[food industry]]). Processed food usually contains several natural ingredients and [[food additive]]s (such as [[food preservation|preservative]]s, antioxidants, emulsifiers, flavour enhancers, etc.).

At home, food is prepared in the [[kitchen]], by the [[cooking|cook]]. The cook sometimes uses a [[cookbook]]. Examples of cooking utensils are [[pressure cooker]]s, [[pot]]s, and [[frying pan]]s.

Food can also be prepared and served in [[restaurant]]s or [[refectory]] (in particular for kids in school).

The utensils used may be a [[plate]], [[knife]], [[fork]], [[chopsticks]], [[spoon]], [[bowl]], or [[spork]].

Many people do not grow their own food. They have to buy food that was grown by someone else. People [[trade|buy]] most of their food in [[shop]]s or [[market]]s. But some people still grow most or all of their own food.

People may buy food and take it home to [[cooking|cook]] it. They may buy food that is ready to eat from a [[market|street vendor]] a [[restaurant]].

== Food-related issues ==
Food shortage is still a big problem in the world today. Many people do not have enough money to buy the food that they need. Bad [[weather]] or other problems sometimes destroy the growing food in one part of the world. When people do not have enough food, we say that they are [[hunger|hungry]]. If they do not eat enough food for a long time, they will become [[disease|sick]] and die from [[starvation]]. In areas where many people do not have enough food, we say that there is [[famine]] there. 

Food can make people [[Illness|sick]] if it is contaminated by [[microorganism]]s, [[bad metals]], or chemicals.

If people do not eat the right foods, they can become sick. 
If people do not eat enough protein, they get the disease called [[kwashiorkor]]. 
If they do not eat enough [[thiamine|vitamin B1]] ([[thiamine]]), they get the disease called [[beriberi]].
If people eat too much food, they can become [[overweight]] or [[obesity|obese]]. This is also bad for people's health.

== Food in religions ==
Many cultures or [[religion]]s have food taboos. That means they have rules what people should not eat, or how the food has to be prepared. Examples of religious food rules are the ''[[Kashrut]]'' of [[Judaism]] and the ''[[Halal]]'' of [[Islam]], that say that [[pig]] meat cannot be eaten. In [[Hinduism]], [[beef]] is not allowed to be eaten.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If someone is found [[Guilt (law)|guilty]] of a [[crime]], their [[punishment]] may be to pay a '''fine''', a certain amount of [[money]]. In many countries, fines can be ordered by police, court [[judge]]s and some government [[officer]]s.

When agreeing to a [[contract]] with a business, a customer may agree to certain rules. If the customer breaks the rules, then they agree to pay a fine for doing so. For example, when somebody [[Car rental|hires a car]] and agrees to return it by Friday, they agree that if they do not return the car by Friday, they must pay a $50 fine to the business.

Johns Hopkins, Baltimore.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Fish''' (plural: fish or fishes) are [[vertebrate]]s which live in water and breathe using [[gills]].

That is a simple way to define fish, but it is not quite accurate. Some [[amphibia]] are not fish, but live in water and have external gills. That is why biologists use a more complicated definition: fish are [[gill]]-bearing [[aquatic]] [[vertebrate]]s which lack [[limb]]s with digits (fingers &amp; toes).

'Fish' is a [[paraphyletic]] term because it lacks a [[monophyletic]] group of descendants. In other words, it lacks the land vertebrates or [[tetrapod]]s, which descended from fish. Fish used to be a [[class (biology)|class]] of [[vertebrate]]s which live in [[water]]. Now the term covers five classes of aquatic vertebrates:
:[[Agnatha|Jawless fish]]
:†[[Placodermi|Armoured fish]]
:[[Chondrichthyes|Cartilaginous fish]]
:[[Actinopterygii|Ray-finned fish]]
:[[Sarcopterygii|Lobe-finned fish]]

Fish are usually covered with scales, and have two sets of paired [[fins]], and several unpaired fins. They are usually cold-blooded. A fish takes in the [[oxygen]] from the water using [[gills]]. There are many different kinds of fish. They live in [[fresh water]] in [[lake]]s and [[river]]s, and in [[salt water]] in the [[ocean]]. Some fish are less than one [[centimeter]] long. The largest fish is the [[whale shark]], which can be almost 15 [[metre|meters]] long and weigh 15 [[ton]]s. Most fish live in the water. A group of fish called the [[Lungfish]] have developed [[lung]]s, because they live in rivers and pools that dry up, certain parts of the year.

Certain animals that have the word ''fish'' in their name are not really fish: [[Crayfish]] are [[crustacean]]s, and [[jellyfish]] are [[Cnidaria]]ns. [[Hagfish]] and [[Lamprey]]s do not have a [[jawbone]]. Hagfish are craniata, Lampreys are Hyperoartia.  Certain animals look like fish, but are not. [[Whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s are [[mammal]]s, for example.

== Fish or fishes? ==
Though often used interchangeably, these words have different meanings. '''''Fish''''' is used either as singular noun or to describe a group of specimens from a single species. '''''Fishes''''' describes a group of different species.&lt;ref name=Helfman&gt;Helfman G, Collette BB, Facey DH and Bowen BW 2009. [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/helfman/ ''The diversity of fishes: biology, evolution, and ecology''] Wiley-Blackwell. ISBN 978-1-4051-2494-2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of fish ==
Fish, the oldest vertebrate group, includes a huge range of types, from the Middle [[Ordovician]], about 490 million years ago, to the present day. These are the main groups:&lt;ref name=Helfman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moyle P.B. and Cech J.J. 2003. ''Fishes: an introduction to Ichthyology''. 5th ed, Cummings. ISBN 978-0-13-100847-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maisey J.G. 1996. ''Discovering fossil fishes''. Holt N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Agnatha]]: the jawless fish. [[Cambrian]] to present day.&lt;ref&gt;Janvier, Philippe 2010. MicroRNAs revive old views about jawless vertebrate divergence and evolution. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (USA)'' '''107''':19137-19138. [http://www.pnas.org/content/107/45/19137.full.pdf+html]&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Pteraspid]]s: the head-shields
** [[Anaspid]]s: gills opened as holes. [[Silurian]] to end-[[Devonian]].
*** [[Cephalaspid]]s: early jawless fish
*** [[Lamprey]]s: living ectoparasites
** [[Osteostraci]]: bony-armoured jawless fish.

* [[Gnathostomata]]: the jawed fish. Includes all types commonly called fish, except the lamprey.
** [[Placoderm]]s: heavily armoured fish
** [[Chondrichthyes]]: cartilaginous fish: [[shark]]s, [[ray]]s and [[skate]]s.
** [[Acanthodii]]: extinct spiny sharks

* [[Osteichthyes]]: bony fish.
** [[Actinopterygii]]: the [[ray-finned fish]].
*** [[Chondrostei]]: [[sturgeon]]s and some other early types.
*** [[Neopterygii]]: first seen in the later Permian, lighter and faster-moving than previous groups.
**** [[Holostei]]: the [[gar]]s and [[bowfin]]s
**** [[Teleost]]ei: the most successful group, [[Triassic]] to present day.
** [[Sarcopterygii]]: the [[lobe-finned fish]]
*** [[Dipnoi]]: the [[lungfish]]; eight [[genera]] survive.
*** [[Coelacanth]]s: two [[species]] survive. They were probably a [[sister-group]] to the [[tetrapod]]s.

== Anatomy ==
[[File:Lampanyctodes hectoris (Hector's lanternfish)2.png|thumb|center|400px|The anatomy of ''Lampanyctodes hectoris'' &lt;br /&gt; 1. operculum (gill cover) 2 &amp; 5. lateral line 3. dorsal fin 4 fat fin 6. caudal fin 7. anal fin 8. photophores 9. pelvic fins paired 10. pectoral fins (paired)]]

=== Bony and cartilagenous fish ===
Most kinds of fish have [[bone]]s. Some kinds of fish, such as [[shark]]s and [[ray]]s, do not have real bones (their [[skeleton]]s are made of [[cartilage]]) they are known as [[cartilaginous fish]].

=== Fish scales ===
All fish are covered with overlapping [[Scale (zoology)|scales]], and each major group of fish has its own special type of scale. Teleosts ('modern' fish) have what are called ''leptoid'' scales. These grow in concentric circles and overlap in a head to tail direction like roof tiles. Sharks and other chondrichthyes have ''placoid'' scales made of denticles, like small versions of their teeth. These also overlap in a head to tail direction, producing a tough outer layer. Shark skin is available for purchase as [[shagreen]], a leather which as original is smooth in one direction, and rough in the other direction. It may be polished for use, but is always rough in texture and resistant to slipping.

The scales are usually covered with a layer of [[slime]] which improves passage through the water, and makes the fish more slippery to a [[predator]].

== Swimming ==
Fish swim by exerting force against the surrounding water. There are exceptions, but this is usually done by the fish contracting muscles on either side of its body in order to generate waves of flexion that travel the length of the body from nose to tail, generally getting larger as they go along. Most fishes generate thrust using lateral movements of their body &amp; tail fin (caudal fin). However, there are also species which move mainly using their median and paired fins. The latter group profits from the gained manoeuvrability that is needed when living in coral reefs for example. But they can not swim as fast as fish using their bodies &amp; caudal fins.&lt;ref&gt;Breder C.M. 2003. The locomotion of fishes. ''Zoologica'', '''4''', 159-256, (1926); ''Journal of Experimental Biology'' '''206''', 2749-2758 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Muscle ===
Fish can swim slowly for many hours using red muscle fibres. They also make short, fast bursts using white muscle. The two types of muscle have a fundamentally different [[physiology]]. The red fibres are usually alongside a much greater amount of white fibres.

==== White fibres ====
The white fibres get their energy by converting the [[carbohydrate]] [[glycogen]] to lactate ([[lactic acid]]). This is [[anaerobic metabolism]], that is, it does not need [[oxygen]]. They are used for fast, short bursts. Once the lactic acid builds up in the muscles, they stop working, and it takes time for the lactate to be removed, and the glycogen replaced.&lt;ref name=McN&gt;Alexander, R. McNeill. 1974. ''Functional design in fishes''. London: Hutchinson, p31. ISBN 0-09-104751-X&lt;/ref&gt; Using their white fibres, fish can reach speeds of 10 lengths per second for short bursts.&lt;ref name=McN/&gt;

==== Red fibres ====
Swimming for long periods needs oxygen for the red fibres. The oxygen supply has to be constant because these fibres only operate [[aerobic]]ally. They are red because they have a rich blood supply, and they contain [[myoglobin]]. Myoglobin transports the oxygen to the oxidising systems. Red muscle gets its energy by oxidising [[fat]], which weight for weight has twice as much energy as carbohydrate or protein.&lt;ref name=McN/&gt; Using their red fibres, fish can keep up a speed of 3{{ndash}}5 lengths per second for long periods.&lt;ref name=McN/&gt;

== Body shape ==
The shape of the body of a fish is important to its swimming. This is because [[wikt:streamline|streamlined]] body shapes makes the water drag less. Here are some common fish shapes.

=== Streamlining ===
[[File:White shark.jpg|thumb|230px|right|alt=A smooth, rocket-shaped shark swims quickly through the water.|The rocket-shape of this shark makes it an efficient swimmer. It is fast over short distances.]]

The picture on the right shows a [[shark]]. This shark's shape is called ''fusiform'', and it is an ovoid shape where both ends of the fish are pointy. This is the best shape for going through water quickly.&lt;ref&gt;Nielsen, Knut Schmidt 1984. ''Scaling: why is animal size so important?'' Cambridge. Chapter 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baily, Jill 1997. ''How fish swim''. Benchmark, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; Fishes with fusiform shapes can chase prey and escape predators quickly. Many live in the open ocean and swim constantly, like [[marlin]]s, [[swordfish]], and [[tuna]]. [[Ichthyosaur]]s, [[porpoise]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[killer whale]]s all have similar shapes. This is an example of [[convergent evolution]].

=== Eel-like ===
The long, ribbon-like shape of an [[eel]]'s body shows another shape.  This enables them to hide in cracks, springing out quickly to capture prey, then returning quickly to their hiding spot.

=== Flatfish ===
[[File:Flounder hawaii.jpg|thumb|230px|alt=a depressed flounder.|An adult flounder has both eyes on the upper side of its body.]]
[[Flatfish]] live on the bottom of the ocean or lake. Most use [[camouflage]]: they change colors to match the ocean floor.

=== Compressed ===
Fish with compressed shapes have flat, vertical bodies, with one eye on each side. They swim upright and can be very thin. They usually live in [[reef]]s where their flat bodies can slip in and out among the [[coral]]s, [[sponge]]s, and rocks, keeping hidden from predators. [[Marine angelfish|Angelfish]], [[surgeonfish]], and [[butterflyfish]] are all compressed fish.

=== Swimming in groups ===
{{main|Shoaling and schooling}}
Many fish swim in groups a lot of the time. Schools of fish can swim together for long distances, and may be chased by predators which also swim in schools. Casual groups are called 'shoals'.

== Fish as food ==
People eat many kinds of fish. The fish that people eat most include [[carp]], [[cod]], [[herring]], [[perch]], [[sardine]]s, [[sturgeon]], [[tilapia]], [[trout]], [[tuna]], and many others. A person who buys and sells fish for eating is called a [[fishmonger]].

=== Fishing ===
{{main|Fishing}}
The word ''to fish'' is also used for the activity of catching fish. People catch fish with small [[Fishing net|nets]] from the side of the water or from small [[boat]]s, or with big [[Fishing net|nets]] from big boats. People can also catch fish with [[fishing pole]]s and fishhooks with [[bait]]. This is often called [[fishing]]. There is also different types of lures that can be used. One is a crank bait. Others are plastic [[worm]]s and rat-l-traps. These are lots of different ways of catching fish.

== Fish as pets ==
Some people keep fish as [[pet]]s. [[Goldfish]] and [[Siamese Fighting Fish]] are popular types of pet fish. [[Koi]] and other ornamental fish are often kept by groups of people in public ponds for their beauty and calming nature.

[[File:Human Feet - female - bruised.jpg|thumb|200px|Woman's feet]]
[[File:Blausen 0411 FootAnatomy.png|thumb|170px|Illustration of bones in lower leg and foot]]

A '''foot''' (one ''foot'', two or more '''feet''') is a [[body]] part on the end of a [[leg]]. We use it when walking, and it is important for balance: it helps us stand straight. We also use it to [[kick]], in both [[fighting]] and [[sport]]s, [[football]] being an example.

People's hands and feet have the same shape: they both have five ''digits'' (the fingers and toes). Many other [[Vertebrate|animals with backbones]] also have five digits. The part of the foot which joins it to the leg is called the ''heel''. The bottom of the foot is called the ''sole''. Half the bones in our body are in the foot. Doctors who work with people's feet are ''podiatrists'' or ''chiropodists''.

Many [[animal]]s have feet, and there are many different sorts of foot. The hard foot of an [[undulate]] is a [[hoof]]. When an animal has soft feet, or feet with soft parts on the underside, we often call it a ''[[paw]]''. 

In many societies, people like to cover the foot when they are with others, especially outside. In many cultures (for example [[North America]]n, [[Europe]]an, [[Japan]]ese and others) people wear clothing over the foot to keep it safe. This [[footwear]] has special names, for example ''sandals'', ''[[shoe]]s'', and ''[[boot]]s''. When people always wear footwear, especially in hot places or when they are very active, their feet can smell badly (''foot odour''). If footwear is too big or small, it can be bad for the feet when the person wears the shoe because it can cause long term damage. People who have foot, leg, and back problems can also get help from special shoes. 

People have different traditions in different parts of the world for when to wear footwear. For example, in much of Europe and [[Canada]], people usually do not wear their shoes or boots in a home or visiting. In the United States people often wear shoes inside a home. In Japan, people do not wear shoes in homes, and floors are often made of very soft materials, too soft for shoes. In cultures where people always wear shoes, people sometimes think it is bad not to wear them. Not wearing shoes can be good for the feet, especially for children's feet.

Conditions like [[Athlete's foot]] affect the feet, causing the feet to feel dry and cracked.

== Bones ==
In a human foot, there are 26 [[bone]]s. They are made up of 14 [[phalanges]] ([[toes]]), 5 [[metatarsals]] ([[sole]] bones) and 7 [[tarsals]] ([[ankle]] bones).

'''France''' ({{lang-fr|France}}), officially the '''French Republic''' ({{lang-fr|République française}}), is a [[country]] in [[Western Europe]]. Its [[capital (city)|capital city]] is [[Paris]]. It is a member of the [[European Union]]. It is known for its [[culture]], its many [[monument]]s and [[structure]]s, and places such as the [[Louvre]], the [[Eiffel Tower]], the [[Arc de Triomphe]], [[Giverny]], [[Mont Saint Michel]], [[Versailles]], and [[Notre Dame de Paris]]. France is divided into 22 ''[[Regions of France|régions]]'' that are further subdivided ''[[Departments of France|départements]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.france-property-and-information.com/France-regions.htm |title=Regions of France |accessdate=2010-08-03 |date=2008 |format=htm |publisher=French Property, Services and Information Ltd }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has been one of the [[great power]]s since the end of the 17th century. In the 18th and 19th centuries, it built a big [[colony|colonial empire]] across [[West Africa]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. Nowadays, this does not exist. It is the most visited country in the world. About 82 million foreign tourists visit it every year.&lt;ref name=&quot;tourism.stat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Direction du Tourisme (French government's tourism agency)|url=http://www.tourisme.gouv.fr/fr/z2/stat/tis/att00018288/TIS_EVE2007_2008-5.pdf|title=Le tourisme international en France en 2007|accessdate=2008-06-05|format=PDF|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080624195206/http://www.tourisme.gouv.fr/fr/z2/stat/tis/att00018288/TIS_EVE2007_2008-5.pdf|archivedate=24 June 2008}} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; France is a founding member of the [[European Union]].

Some well-known cities in France include [[Nice]], [[Nancy]], [[Marseille]], [[Bordeaux]], [[Lille]], [[Lyon]], [[Toulouse]], Limoges, [[Strasbourg]], [[Rennes]], [[Nantes]] and [[Paris]].

== Geography and climate ==
France is in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essex.ac.uk/armedcon/world/europe/western_europe/default.html|title=Western Europe|accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; France has [[border]]s with [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], [[Italy]], [[Monaco]], [[Andorra]], and [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kwintessential1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/articles/article/France/Geography-of-France/540|title=French Geography|accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; France has two [[mountain]] ranges near its borders: the [[Alps]] in the east and the [[Pyrenees]] in the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;kwintessential1&quot;/&gt; There are many rivers in France, including the [[Seine]] and the [[Loire River|Loire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.francethisway.com/tourism/french-rivers.php|title=French Rivers|accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the north and the west of France, there are low hills and river valleys.

In France there are many different [[climate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldtravelguide.net/country/92/climate/Europe/France.html|title=Climates of France|author=World Travel Guide|accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] has a major effect on the weather in the north and west. This means the temperature is about the same most of the year. It is in the marine west coast climate region. In the east, winters are cold and the [[weather]] is good. Summers are hot and stormy. In the south, winters are cool and [[rain|wet]]. Summers are hot and dry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.francetourism.com/practicalinfo/general.htm |publisher=French Tourist Office|accessdate=2009-09-30|title=Practical Information on France – General}}&lt;/ref&gt; The north has a temperate climate similar to that of the United Kingdom and other Northern European countries.

France has the second-largest [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ) in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.developpementdurable.com/economie/2010/07/A2769/mediterranee-la-france-prend-le-controle-en-creant-une-zone-economique-exclusive.html|title=EEZ of France|accessdate=1 August 2010}} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers 11,035,000 [[square kilometre|km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]] (4,260,637 [[square miles|sq mi]]). Only the [[United States]] has a larger one.

== History ==
The name &quot;France&quot; comes from the [[Latin]] word ''Francia'', which literally means &quot;land of the [[Franks]]&quot; or &quot;Frankland&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesunchronicle.com/articles/2008/04/20/features/3057797.txt|title=Origin of Francia|author=The Sun Chronicle|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The borders of modern France are about the same as those of ancient [[Gaul]]. [[Celt]]ic Gauls inhabited Ancient Gaul. [[Julius Caesar]] conquered Gaul for [[Roman Empire|Rome]] in the 1st century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverfrance.net/France/History/Roman_Empire.shtml|title=Caesar Conquered Gaul|work=discoverfrance.net|author=Discover France|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the Gauls adopted [[Romance languages|Roman]] speech ([[Latin]], from which the [[French language]] evolved) and Roman culture. [[History of Christianity|Christianity]] first appeared in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. It became firmly established by the fourth and fifth centuries.

[[File:Map France 1477-fr.svg|thumb|left|France in 1477. Red line: Limit of the Kingdom of France; Light blue: the royal domain]]
In the 4th century AD, the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]], principally the [[Franks]] invaded the Gauls. This is how the name ''Francie'' appeared. The modern name &quot;France&quot; comes from the name of the [[Capetian dynasty|Capetian]] Kings of France around Paris. The Franks were the first tribe of Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire to convert to  Christianity rather than [[Arianism]]. The French called themselves &quot;the most Christian Kingdom of France&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wf-f.org/03-1-France.html|title=France used this pretext to call themselves this|author=wff|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843), divided [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Empire]] into three parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.francebalade.com/histo/carolin.htm|title=Division of Charlemagne's empire into three parts|author=France Balade|accessdate=3 August 2010}} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biggest area was Western Francia. It is similar to modern France.

The [[Carolingian]] [[dynasty]] [[rule]]d France until 987, when [[Hugh Capet of France|Hugh Capet]] became [[King of France]]. His descendants, the [[Capetian dynasty|Direct Capetians]], the [[House of Valois]] and the [[House of Bourbon]], [[wikt:unify|unified]] the country with many wars and dynastic inheritance. The monarchy was the most [[power]]ful during the 17th century and the reign of [[Louis XIV of France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uncg.edu/rom/courses/dafein/civ/timeline.htm|title=French History - Le Grand Siècle|author=UNCG|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, France had the [[Demographics of France|largest population in Europe]]. The country had a big influence over European [[politics]], [[economy]], and [[culture]]. [[French language|French]] became the common language of [[diplomacy]] in international affairs. Much of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] happened in France. French scientists made big [[Science|scientific]] discoveries in the 18th century. France also [[invasion|conquered]] many [[French overseas collectivities|overseas possessions]] in the Americas, Africa and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.understandfrance.org/France/History3.html|title=French colonies History|author=Understand France|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France had a [[monarchy]] until the [[French Revolution]] in 1789. King [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and his wife, [[Marie Antoinette]], were [[executed]] in 1793.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lucidcafe.com/library/95nov/antoinette.html|title=Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette's executions|author=Lucidcafé|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of other French citizens were also killed. [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] took control of the Republic in 1799. He later made himself Emperor of the First Empire (1804–1814). His armies conquered most of [[Europe|continental Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleonguide.com/campind.htm|title=Campaigns of Napoleon Bonaparte|author=Napoleonguide.com|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[metric system]] was invented by French scientists during the French revolution.

After Napoleon's final defeat in 1815 at the [[Battle of Waterloo]], another  monarchy arose. Later [[Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte]] created the Second Empire in 1852. Louis-Napoléon was removed after the defeat in the [[Franco-Prussian war]] of 1870. The Third Republic replaced his [[regime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intellego.fr/soutien-scolaire-3eme/aide-scolaire-Education-civique-juridique-et-sociale/Les-regimes-politiques-de-France-de-1780-a-nos-jours./31424|title=Regimes of France|author=Intellego|accessdate=3 August 2010}} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The large [[French colonial empire]] in the 19th century included parts of [[West Africa]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. The culture and politics of these regions were [[influence]]d by France. Many [[colony|ex-colonies]] officially speak the [[French language|French]] language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alsintl.com/resources/languages/French/|title=French language in Colonies|author=alsintl.com|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country was where both the [[WWI|First]] and [[WWII|Second World Wars]] took place. During the First World War, millions were killed in the trenches including over a million in the [[Battle of the Somme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/battles/somme.htm|title=Battle of the Somme|author=firstworldwar.com|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conditions were very poor. The last surviving veteran was Pierre Picault who died on 20 November 2008 at the age of 109.&lt;ref name=&quot;France&quot;&gt;[http://dersdesders.free.fr/france.html Ders Des Ders Report - France] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the Second World War, [[Nazi]]s [[wikt:occupy|occupied]] France. The Allies landed in Normandy on June 6, 1944 and began the [[Battle of Normandy]]. German forces lost France in just a few months.

== Divisions ==
[[File:France departements regions narrow.jpg|thumb|The 22 [[regions of France|regions]] ]] The 22 regions and 96 [[departments of France|departments]] of [[metropolitan France]] includes [[Corsica]] (''Corse'', lower right). The Paris area is expanded. France is divided into (administrative) [[region]]s. 22 of them are in [[Metropolitan France]]:
{|
|-

2. [[Aquitaine]]&lt;br /&gt;
3. [[Auvergne]]&lt;br /&gt;

9. [[Corsica]]&lt;br /&gt;
10. [[Free County]]&lt;br /&gt;
11. [[Upper Normandy]]&lt;br /&gt;

12. [[Île-de-France]]&lt;br /&gt;
13. [[Languedoc-Roussillon]]&lt;br /&gt;
14. [[Limousin]]&lt;br /&gt;
15. [[Lorraine]]&lt;br /&gt;
16. [[Midi-Pyrénées]]&lt;br /&gt;
17. [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]]&lt;br /&gt;
18. [[Pays de la Loire]]&lt;br /&gt;
19. [[Picardy]]&lt;br /&gt;
20. [[Poitou-Charentes]]&lt;br /&gt;
21. [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]]&lt;br /&gt;
22. [[Rhône-Alpes]]&lt;br /&gt;
|
|}
Corsica has a different status than the other 21 metropolitan regions. It is called ''[[collectivité territoriale]]''.

France also has five [[Overseas Regions of France|overseas regions]]:
:{|
| valign=&quot;top&quot; |
# [[Guadeloupe]] (in the Caribbean)
# [[French Guiana]] (in South America)
# [[Martinique]] (in the Caribbean)
# [[Réunion]] (in the Indian Ocean).
# [[Mayotte]] (in the Indian Ocean)
These four overseas regions have the same status as the metropolitan ones. They are like the overseas American states of [[Alaska]] and [[Hawaii]].
|}
Then France is divided into [[Departments of France|100 departments]]. The departments are divided into 342 [[Arrondissements of France|arrondissements]]. The ''arrondissements'' are re-divided into 4,032 [[Cantons of France|cantons]]. The smallest [[Administrative division|subdivision]] is the [[Communes of France|commune]]. On January 1, 2008, [[INSEE]] counted 36,781 communes in France. 36,569 of them are in [[metropolitan France]] and 212 of them are in [[overseas France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/methodes/nomenclatures/cog/documentation.asp| title=Code officiel géographique – Présentation|first=[[Government of France]]| last=[[INSEE]]|accessdate=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.insee.fr/fr/methodes/default.asp?page=nomenclatures/cog/outremer.htm| title=Code des collectivités d'outre-mer (COM)|first=[[Government of France]]| last=[[INSEE]]|accessdate=2008-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Government ==
The government of France is  a [[semi-presidential system]] determined by the [[French Constitution]] of the French Fifth [[French Republic|Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Semi-presidential_system|title=France's political system}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution declares the nation to be &quot;an indivisible, [[secular]], [[Democracy|democratic]], and [[social]] [[Republic]]&quot;. It provides for a [[separation of powers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/europe/francophone/principles_en.pdf|title=Separation of Powers|author=Guy Carcassonne|publisher=unc.edu|accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French [[armed forces]] are divided into four branches:
* The ''Armée de Terre'' (Army)
* The ''Marine Nationale'' (Navy)
* The ''Armée de l'Air'' (Air Force)
* The ''Gendarmerie Nationale'' (A military force which acts as a [[National]] [[Rural]] [[Police]])

France has about 359,000 military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.csis.org/media/csis/pubs/060626_asia_balance_powers.pdf|title=Number of military personnel in France, page 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=http://www.csis.org/media/csis/pubs/westmb012302%5B1%5D.pdf|title=Number of military personnel in France, page 112}}&lt;/ref&gt; France spends 2.6% of its [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) on [[defence]]. This is the highest in the [[European Union]]. France and the [[UK]] spend 40% of the EU defence [[budget]]. About 10% of France's defence budget is for its [[nuclear weapons]] force.

France is a member of the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/members/index.shtml#f|title=Members of the UN|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a permanent member of the [[United Nations Security Council]] and has [[veto]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/sc/members.asp|title=Members of the Security council|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a member of the [[World Trade Organisation]] (WTO). It hosts the headquarters of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], [[UNESCO]] and [[Interpol]]. In [[1953]], the [[United Nations]] asked France to choose a [[coat of arms]] to represent them internationally. The French emblem is now on their [[passport]]s.

France was a founding member of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/abc/history/index_en.htm|title=History of the EU|publisher=European Union|accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, France wanted to exclude the [[United Kingdom]] from the [[organisation]]. It wanted to build its own [[Economy|economic]] [[Influence|power]] in continental [[Europe]].  France and [[Germany]] became closer after [[World War II]].  This was to try to become the most influential country in the EU.  It limited the influence of the new [[Eastern Europe]]an members. France is a member of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO).&lt;ref name=&quot;nato&quot; /&gt; However, under [[Charles de Gaulle|President de Gaulle]], it left the joint military command. In the early 1990s, France received [[criticism]] for its underground [[nuclear weapons|nuclear]] tests in [[French Polynesia]]. France vigorously opposed the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2688117.stm|title=Opposition of the war in Iraq|publisher=BBC website|accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; France retains strong political and economic influence in its former [[Africa]]n colonies. For instance it has supplied economic aid and troops for peace-keeping missions in the [[Ivory Coast]] and [[Chad]].

=== Literature ===
{{main|French literature}}
[[File:Dartagnan-musketeers.jpg|right|thumb|''The Three Musketeers'' by [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]]]]
French literature began in the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverfrance.net/France/Literature/DF_literature.shtml|title=French literature started in the Middle Ages}}&lt;/ref&gt; French was divided into several dialects at the time. Some authors [[spelling|spelled]] words differently from one other.

During the 17th century, [[Pierre Corneille]], [[Jean Racine]], [[Molière]] [[Blaise Pascal]] and [[René Descartes]] were the main authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://17emesiecle.free.fr/Auteurs.php|title=French authors of the 17th century|author=17eme siecle|accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th and 19th centuries, French literature and poetry reached its best. The 18th century saw writings of authors, [[essay]]ists and [[moral]]ists as [[Voltaire]] and [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]].
As for French children's literature in those times, [[Charles Perrault]] wrote stories such as &quot;[[Little Red Riding Hood]]&quot;, &quot;[[Beauty and the Beast]]&quot;, &quot;[[Sleeping Beauty]]&quot; and &quot;[[Puss in Boots]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perraultfairytales.com/en/stories|title=Perrault's tales|accessdate=2010-09-12|Publisher=PerraultFairyTales.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many famous French novels were written in the 19th century by author such as [[Victor Hugo]], [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]] and [[Jules Verne]]. They wrote popular novels like [[The Three Musketeers]], [[The Count of Monte-Cristo]], [[Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea]], or [[The Hunchback of Notre-Dame]]. Other 19th century fiction writers include [[Emile Zola]], [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Stendhal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discoverfrance.net/France/Literature/DF_literature.shtml |title=French Literature |accessdate=2010-08-03 |last=Boorsch |first=Jean |date=1996 |format=html |work=Discoverfrance.net |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sports ===
[[File:TourDeFrance 2005 07 09.jpg|right|thumb|The ''Peloton'' (means &quot;pack&quot; in French) of the [[Tour de France]]]]
The [[Tour de France]] [[cycling]] [[Racing|race]] in July is one of the best-known [[sport]]ing events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weightlossdietinformation.com/the-tour-de-france-the-most-famous-bicycle-race-in-the-world.html|title=Famous tour de France|author=Damian Papworth|accessdate=2010-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a three-week race of around 3,500&amp;nbsp;km that covers most of France and ends in the centre of Paris, on the ''Avenue des Champs-Elysées''. [[Football (soccer)|Football]] is another popular sport in France. The French team won the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1998 and the [[UEFA European Football Championship]] in 1984 and 2000. France also hosts the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] [[car race]]. France also hosted the [[Rugby World Cup]] in 2007 and finished fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://french.lovetoknow.com/Popular_French_Sports |title=Popular French Sports |accessdate=2010-08-03 |last1=Dautaj |first1=Jacqueline |last2=Delp |first2=Valorie |last3=Finley |first3=Amy |work=LoveToKnow Corp. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
France is closely associated with the [[Olympic Games|Modern Olympic Games]]. At the end of the 19th century, the [[Baron]] [[Pierre de Coubertin]] suggested having the Olympic Games again. France hosted the [[Summer Olympics]] twice, in 1900 and 1924, in [[Paris]]. France also hosted the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Games]] three times: in 1924 in [[Chamonix]], in 1968 in [[Grenoble]], and in 1992 in [[Albertville]].

=== Cuisine === &lt;!-- [[French cuisine]] redirects here --&gt;
[[File:Terrine de saumon au basilic.JPG|thumb|right|230px|Basil salmon [[Terrine (food)|terrine]]]]

French cuisine has influenced the style of cooking throughout Europe, and its chefs work in restaurants throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delices-du-monde.fr/recettes-francaise.html|title=Diversity of French Cuisine|accessdate=1 August 2010}}{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The roots of modern ''haute cuisine'' lie in chefs like [[François Pierre La Varenne|La Varenne]] (1615–1678) and the notable chef of [[Napoleon]], [[Marie-Antoine Carême]] (1784–1833). These chefs developed a lighter style of food compared to the food of the [[Middle Ages]]. They used fewer spices, and more [[herb]]s and creamy ingredients.

Typical ingredients like [[roux]] and fish stock, and techniques such as [[marinade|marinading]], and dishes such as [[ragout]], were invented. Carême was an expert pâtissier (pastry-maker), and this is still a mark of French cooking. He developed basic sauces, his 'mother sauces'; he had over a hundred sauces in his repertoire, based on the half-dozen mother sauces.

French cuisine was introduced in the 20th century by [[Auguste Escoffier|Georges Auguste Escoffier]] (1846–1935). He was a genius at organisation. He worked out how to run large restaurants, as in a big hotel or a palace; how the staff should be organised; how the menu was prepared. He had methods for everything. Escoffier's largest contribution was the publication of ''Le Guide Culinaire'' in 1903, which established the fundamentals of French cookery. Escoffier managed the restaurants and cuisine at the [[Savoy Hotel]] and [[Carlton Hotel]] in [[London]], the [[Hôtel Ritz Paris]], and some of the greatest cruise ships.

Escoffier, however, left out much of the culinary character to be found in the [[regions of France]].

Gastro-tourism and the ''[[Guide Michelin]]'' helped to acquaint people with the rich [[bourgeois]] and peasant cuisine of the French countryside in the 20th century. [[Gascony|Gascon]] cuisine has also had great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France. Many dishes that were once regional have proliferated in variations across the country. [[Cheese]] and [[wine]] are a major part of the cuisine, playing different roles regionally and nationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodcooking.com/frcheese.htm|title=French Cheeses|accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.franceway.com/cheese/|title=French Cheese|accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trifter.com/practical-travel/world-cuisine/top-10-most-tasty-cuisines-in-the-world/|title=The world's best cuisines|accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[north]] of France, people often prefer to use [[butter]] to [[wikt:cook|cook]]. In the [[south]], they prefer [[olive oil]] and [[garlic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5jvmxWfyZ2tFVA3qcmC7DkX6SMi5g|title=Butter and oil in French Cuisine|accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France, each [[Regions of France|region]] has its own special [[dish]]; [[choucroute]] in [[Alsace]], [[quiche]] in [[Lorraine]], [[cassoulet]] in the [[Languedoc-Roussillon]], and [[tapenade]] in [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]].

In November 2010, '''French gastronomy''' was added by [[UNESCO]] to its lists of the world's 'intangible cultural heritage'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/world/stories/DN-culture_17int.ART.State.Edition1.b21e71.html Bon appétit: Your meal is certified by the U.N.] Dallas Morning News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/celebrations_healing_techniques_crafts_and_culinary_arts_added_to_the_representative_list_of_the_intangible_cultural_heritage/ Celebrations, healing techniques, crafts and culinary arts added to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tourism ===
[[File:Chateau-de-versailles-cour.jpg|thumb|The [[Palace of Versailles]] is one of the most popular tourist destinations in France.]]
France is the number one [[tourist]] destination in the world. In 2007, 81.9 million foreign tourists visited France.&lt;ref name=&quot;tourism.stat&quot;/&gt; [[Spain]] comes second (58.5 million in 2006) and the [[United States]] come third (51.1 million in 2006).
Some of the most famous attractions in Paris, are the [[Eiffel Tower]] and the [[Arc de Triomphe]]. Another one is [[Mont Saint Michel]], in [[Normandy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.culture.gouv.fr/deps/mini_chiff_03/fr/musee.htm|title=Musées et Monuments historiques}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A European [[Disneyland]] is located in a [[suburb]] east of Paris. The resort opened in 1992 and is also a popular tourist destination in [[Europe]].

According to the Finnish Constitution, the president has no possibility to rule the government without the ministerial approval, and does not have the power to dissolve the parliament under his or her own desire. Finland is actually represented by its prime minister, and not by its president, in the Council of the Heads of State and Government of the European Union. The 2012 constitution reduced the powers of the president even further.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Europe location FIN.png|thumb|240px|Finland on a map of Europe]]
'''Finland''' (''Suomi'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]) is a [[country]] in the  Northern [[Europe]] and is a member state of the [[European Union]]. Finland is one of the [[Nordic countries]]. It is also part of [[Fennoscandia]]. Finland is between the 60th and 70th latitudes North. Its neighbours are [[Sweden]] in the west, [[Norway]] in the north, [[Russia]] in the east and [[Estonia]] in the south, beyond the sea called Gulf of Finland. Most of the western and southern Finland is seashore of the [[Baltic Sea]].

The [[Capital (city)|capital]] of Finland is [[Helsinki]]. The [[currency]] of Finland is the [[euro]] (EUR); before 2002 it was the ''markka'', the Finnish mark (FIM). The [[president]] of Finland is [[Sauli Niinistö]]. 5.3 million people live in Finland. [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] are the official [[language]]s of Finland. Most people in Finland speak Finnish, but about six [[percent]] of Finland's people speak Swedish as their [[mother tongue]], living mostly in the western part of Finland and on [[Åland]] (Finnish Ahvenanmaa). Finland became [[Independence|independent]] in 1917.

The most important cities and towns in Finland are [[Helsinki]], [[Espoo]], [[Tampere]], [[Vantaa]], [[Turku]], [[Oulu]], [[Lahti]], [[Kuopio]], [[Jyväskylä]] and [[Pori]]. 

Finland is a highly industrialized [[First World]] country. The most important Finnish industrial products are [[paper]], [[steel]] products such as machines, and electronics.

[[Nokia]] (the mobile company) is originally a company of Finland, named after a small town called Nokia. 

Also, Finland has had the most least corrupt titles on the [[Corruption Perceptions Index]].

== People and culture ==
The people of Finland are called Finns. Most Finns speak [[Finnish language|Finnish]] as their mother tongue; 6% of Finns have the [[Swedish language]] as their mother tongue.  Finns also study mandatory English and Swedish in school. Most Finns work either in services (that is: shops, banks, offices or businesses) or in factories. Finns often like [[sauna]]s and [[nature]]. Many Finnish families have [[summer cottage|summer cottages]], small houses where they go to relax on their summer holidays. The most important [[festival]]s that Finnish people celebrate are [[Midsummer]] and [[Christmas]]. [[Santa Claus]] is an old Finnish tradition, although later the [[Coca-Cola]] company introduced him to the world.

The most popular sports in Finland are [[ice hockey]], [[skiing]], [[track and field]] and [[association football]] (soccer). Recently Finns have also won many events in [[swimming]], [[motor sports]] and [[gymnastics]].

There is a very small group (a minority) of a few thousand [[Sami people|Samis]] (also called Lapps) in the most northern part of Finland, called [[Lapland]]. Most of the Samis live in [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]. Many Sami people farm [[reindeer]]s. Originally Samis were [[hunter-gatherers]]. In the past the Sami were [[nomad]]s, but nowadays they live in regular houses.

Very few people in Finland, approximately 2%, are from other countries, The number of foreigners in Finland has recently been growing rapidly.

== Nature and weather ==
[[File:Koli hill view.jpg|thumb|250|This picture is from [[Koli]], [[North Karelia]]]]
Most of Finland is covered by pine [[forest]]. The [[swan]], which was considered holy long ago, is the national bird of Finland. Wood is the most important natural resource of Finland. It is estimated that up to one-third of all wood resources of the European Union are in Finland.

The national animal of Finland is the brown bear. And the largest animal is the [[elk]], a type of moose, which itself is part of the deer family.

There are also hundreds of rivers and thousands of lakes with fresh water. [[Fishing]] is a popular [[sport]]. It is estimated there are almost 180,000 lakes in Finland.

Many islands in the [[Baltic Sea]] belong to Finland, too. Thousands of islands are part of the [[Åland]] [[archipelago]]. Tourists from all over the world come to see the fells and the [[Aurora|northern lights]] in [[Lapland]].

The highest mountain of Finland is Halti, which is 1328 meters high. The largest lake is Saimaa, 4,400 square kilometres. The longest river of Finland is Tornionjoki. The largest river (by watershed) is Kemijoki, 552 kilometres long.

The weather in Finland varies widely by season.  Summer usually lasts from May to early September, and temperatures can reach up to +35 °C.  Autumns are dark and rainy. Winter snow usually begins to fall in Helsinki in early December (in Lapland it can fall as early as October) and in the winter the temperature can drop to -30 °C.  Winter usually lasts to mid-March, when the snow melts in Helsinki (in Lapland the snow usually doesn't melt until early May), and Spring lasts till late May. Spring can be erratic, and the weather can change from frost to sunshine wthin a matter of days. The famed Northern Lights are common in Lapland.

== History of Finland ==
People first came to Finland 10,000 years ago. That was just after an [[ice age]], after a glacier that covered the ground had receded.

Some think the first people in Finland already spoke a language that is related to Finnish that is spoken today. It is known for sure that an early form of the Finnish language was spoken in Finland in the [[Iron Age]]. (The Iron Age in Finland was 2,500–800 years ago).

The first residents in Finland hunted animals, as &quot;[[hunter-gatherer]]s&quot;.  Some people started to [[agriculture|farm]] crops about 5,200 years ago. Farming slowly became more and more popular and became the major way of life until the modern age. 

[[File:Vasarakirves.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Stone [[axe]] from Finland.]]

The ancient Finns were [[paganism|pagans]], like most Europeans, as well as most people everywhere. The most important god of the Finnish pantheon was [[Ukko]]. He was a god of [[sky]] and [[thunder]], much like Odin, another Scandinavian god-king. These powers were common among the pagan god kings in pantheons ranging from the Finnish Ukko, to the Scandinavian/Germanic/Saxon Odin, all the way east to Zeus of the Greeks and Jupiter of the Romans. 

Around a thousand years ago when most of Europe were adopting Christianity, eventually Finland followed suit.  During the [[Reformation]] of Christianity in the 16th century, most Finns became P[[protestant|rotestant]]s. Some pagan practices still remain amongst the now Christian Finns, such as [[bear worship]].

From the [[Middle Ages]] Finland was a part of [[Sweden]]. Then, in the year [[1809]], [[Russia]] took Finland from Sweden. Finland was a part of Russia, but after a short period of time it became [[autonomy|autonomous]], which means that the Finns essentially controlled Finland, though the Tsar was in control officially. Finns could create their own laws and had their own currency, (called the ''[[markka]]''), their own [[stamp]]s and own [[custom]]s. However, Finland did not have its own [[army]].

[[File:Finnish soldiers during the Winter War.jpg|thumb|250px|Finnish soldiers at the time of war]] 
On 6 December 1917, Finland became independent, which meant that it no longer was a part of Russia. There was a [[communism|communist]] revolution in Russia and after 1922 Russia was a part of the [[Soviet Union]]. There were communists in Finland too, who tried to create a revolution in Finland. This attempt at revolution caused the [[Finnish civil war]]. The communists lost the civil war, and Finland did not change its old capitalist system.

[[Stalin]], who was the leader of the Soviet Union, did not like having a capitalist country as its neighbour. Stalin wanted Finland to become a communist state and be a part of the Soviet Union. The leaders of Finland refused: they wanted to stay independent. The Soviet Union sent many troops across the eastern border of Finland to try to make Finland join them, which resulted in the Winter War. There were many battles, that eventually resulted in Finland losing areas along its eastern border to the Soviet Union.

[[Adolf Hitler]] was the dictator of Germany, and wanted to invade the Soviet Union. Finland wanted to retrieve the areas that it had lost, so they joined the German invasion, which started in 1941. This part of the [[Second World War]] is called the [[Continuation War]] in Finland. However, Finland was not a [[fascism|fascist]] or an [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] country. Finns were interested in freedom rather than dictatorship.

While Germany was losing the war, Finland had already progressed into the Soviet Union in order to regain the areas lost in the previous peace. Finland wanted to end the war with the Soviet Union, which resulted in peace, but once again Finland had to relinquish the areas that they had conquered. This time, the peace with the Soviet Union made Finland and Germany enemies. Finns fought Germans, and Germans retreated to Norway, burning down the whole of Lapland behind them. This is called [[War of Lapland]]. Finland remained independent.

After the war, many factories were built in Finland. Many people moved from farms to cities. At that time, big factories manufactured products like [[paper]] and [[steel]]. More and more people worked in more advanced jobs, like [[high technology]]. Also, many people went to universities to get a good education. Finland was one of the first countries where most people had [[Internet]] connections and mobile phones. A well-known company that makes [[mobile phone]]s, [[Nokia]], is from Finland.

Finland joined the [[European Union]] in 1995. The Finnish currency, the ''[[markka]]'' (mark), was changed to the European Union's currency, the [[euro]], in 2002.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Mature flower diagram.svg|thumb|400px|Diagram of flower, cut open, shows where the [[ovary (botany)|ovary]] is]] 
In [[botany]], a '''fruit''' is a plant structure that contains the plant's [[seed]]s. The word ''fruit'' is used only if it comes from the part of the [[flower]] which was an [[ovary (botany)|ovary]].&lt;ref&gt;Mauseth, James D. 2003. ''Botany: an introduction to plant biology''. Jones &amp; Bartlett, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an extra layer round the seeds, which may or may not be fleshy. However, even in botany, there is no general agreement on how fruits should be classified. Many do have extra layers from other parts of the flower.&lt;ref&gt;Schlegel, Rolf 2003. ''Encyclopedic dictionary of plant breeding and related subjects''. Haworth Press. ISBN 1-56022-950-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

The fleshy part of a fruit is called the mesocarp. It is between the fruit's skin (exocarp) and the seeds. The white part of an [[apple]], for example, is the &quot;fleshy&quot; part of the apple. Usually, when we eat a fruit, we eat the &quot;fleshy&quot; part.

== Types of fruits ==
[[File:Grapes.jpg|thumb|thumb|left|140px|alt=Grapes hanging on a branch|Grapes are berries.]]
===Berry===
If the entire fruit is fleshy, except for maybe a thin skin, we call the fruit a [[berry]]. A berry might contain one seed or many. [[Grape]]s, [[avocado]]s, and [[blueberry|blueberries]] are berries. They all have a thin skin, but most of the fruit is fleshy. [[Strawberry|Strawberries]], however, are actually ''not'' berries, because the seeds are on the outside: on a real berry, the seed or seeds must be inside.&lt;ref name=fb&gt;{{cite book | last = Fulbright| first =Jeannie | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =''Exploring Creation with Botany''| publisher = Apologia Educational Ministries, Inc.| date = 2004| location = 1106 Meridian Plaza, Suite 220| pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 1-932012-49-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pepo===
A pepo (pronounced ''pee' po'') is a [[wikt:modify|modified]] berry. Its skin is hard and thick and is usually called a &quot;rind.&quot; &lt;ref name=fb/&gt; [[Pumpkin]]s and [[watermelon]]s, for instance, are pepos.

===Hesperidium===
[[File:Citrus fruits.jpg|thumb|170px|Citrus fruits are hesperidiums.]]
A hesperidium (pronounced ''hes' per id' ee uhm'') is another modified berry. It has a [[leather]]y skin that is not as hard as the skin of a pepo. All [[citrus]] fruit like [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]] and [[lemon]] are hesperidiums.&lt;ref name=fb/&gt;

[[File:PearPhoto.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Pears have a core surrounded by yummy flesh, meaning pears are pomes.]]
===Pome===
A pome (pohm) is a fruit that has a [[wikt:core|core]] surrounded by fleshy [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] that we can eat. The core is usually not eaten.&lt;ref name=fb/&gt; Berries are different - the seeds are ''inside'' the fleshy part, not separated from it by a core. [[Apple]]s and [[pear]]s are pomes.

===Drupe===
[[File:Autumn Red peaches.jpg|thumb|170px|The big hard &quot;pit&quot; in the middle of this peach has a seed inside it.]]
Drupes are also called [[stone fruit]]. A drupe is a fleshy fruit with a hard stone around the seed. We usually call this stone the &quot;pit&quot; of the fruit. [[Peach]]es and [[Olive (fruit)|olives]] are drupes.&lt;ref name=fb/&gt; Actually, the [[almond]] fruit is a drupe, too,&lt;ref name=fb/&gt; though we eat the seed that is inside the &quot;pit&quot; of the [[almond]] fruit.

== Botanical fruits ==
Since fruits are produced from fertilised ovaries in [[flower]]s, only [[flowering plant]]s produce fruits. Fruits are an [[evolution]]ary 'invention' which help [[seed]]s get [[wikt:dispersal|dispersed]] by animals.

The botanical term includes many that are not &quot;fruits&quot; in the common sense of the term. such as the vegetables [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[pumpkin]]s, [[cucumber]]s, [[tomato]], [[pea]]s, [[bean]]s, [[corn]], [[eggplant]], and [[sweet pepper]] and some spices, such as [[allspice]] and [[chillie]]s.

=== Accessory fruits ===
[[File:FraiseFruitPhoto.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Strawberry]] fruit: the 'seeds' are each derived from a [[pistil]] of the flower.]]
An accessory fruit or false fruit (pseudocarp) is a fruit in which some of the flesh is derived not from the ovary but from some adjacent tissue.

A fig is a type of accessory fruit called a syconium. [[Pome]]s, such as [[apple]]s and [[pear]]s, are also accessory fruits: the core is the true fruit.&lt;ref&gt;Esau, K. 1977. ''Anatomy of seed plants''. Wiley New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-botanical fruits ==
Strictly speaking, these are not botanical fruits: 
* any produced by non-flowering plants, like [[juniper]] berries, which are the seed-containing female cones of conifers.
* fleshy fruit-like growths that develop from other plant tissues (like [[rhubarb]]).

== Area of agreement ==
[[File:vaccinium.jpg|thumb|Berries which are simple fleshy fruit. From top right: [[Cranberry|cranberries]], [[lingonberries]], [[blueberries]] red [[Huckleberry|huckleberries]]]]

These are fruits which you can buy in shops, and which are also acceptable as botanical fruits:
* [[berry fruits]]: [[redcurrant]], [[gooseberry]], [[tomato]], [[avocado]]
* [[false berries]]: [[banana]], [[cranberry]], [[blueberries]]
* [[stone fruit]]s or drupes: [[plum]], [[cherry]], [[peach]], [[apricot]], [[Olive (fruit)|olive]]
* [[citrus|citrus fruits]], like [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[grapefruit]]s, and [[tangerine]]s
* [[aggregate fruit]]s: [[raspberry|raspberries]], [[blackberry|blackberries]]
* [[multiple fruit]]s: [[pineapple]]s, figs

Many fruits come from [[tree]]s or [[shrub|bushes]]. For plants, fruits are a means of dispersal, usually by animals. When the fruit breaks apart, the seeds can go into the ground and begin to grow. Most fruits we eat contain a lot of [[water]] and natural [[sugar]]s, and many are high in [[Vitamin C]]. They have a large amount of [[dietary fibre]]. Fruits are usually low in [[protein]] and [[fat]] content, but avocados and some nuts are exceptions to this. Not only humans, but our closest living relatives ([[primates]]) are keen fruit-eaters. So are many other groups of [[herbivorous]] [[mammal]]s and many [[bird]]s.

== Seedless fruits ==
Seedlessness is an important feature of some fruits of commerce. Commercial bananas, pineapple, and [[watermelon]]s are examples of seedless fruits. Some [[citrus]] fruits, especially oranges, satsumas, mandarin oranges, and [[grapefruit]] are valued for their seedlessness.

Seedless bananas and grapes are [[ploidy|triploids]], and seedlessness results from the abortion of the [[embryo]]nic plant which is produced by fertilisation. The method requires normal pollination and fertilisation.&lt;ref&gt;Spiegel-Roy P. Goldschmidt E.E. 1996. ''The biology of citrus''. Cambridge. ISBN 0-521-33321-0 p87–88&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''farm''' is a piece of [[land]] used to [[grow]] [[plant]]s  and/or [[raise]] [[animal]]s for [[food]].

People who grow these plants or raise these animals are called [[farmer]]s. This type of work is called farming. 

Land that is used to grow plants for food, or could be used to grow plants for food is called [[arable]] land. A life raising animals for food is called a [[pastoral]] life. 

Many farms in richer countries are very large and can cause damage.
There are many types of farming. Some people farm to eat the food they produce ([[subsistence agriculture]]). Opposite that, some companies have very large farms to sell the food to many people far away in [[urban area]]s (industrial farming). Usually, subsistence farming is prevalent (more used) in poorer countries, while industrial farming is prevalent in richer countries.

==Names of Farms==
[[File:Tea plantation in India02.jpg|thumb|alt=Tea plantation|A [[tea]] plantation in [[India]]]]
* A farm that produces [[fruit]]s or [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]] is called an ''orchard''.
* A farm that produces [[grape]]s is called a ''vineyard''.
* A farm that raises and trains [[horse]]s is called a ''stable''.
* A farm that produces [[milk]] and [[dairy|dairy products]] is called a ''dairy farm''.
* If the animals are raised for [[meat]] it is a [[ranch]].
* A large farm that produces non-essential crops like [[tobacco]], [[coffee]], [[cotton]] or [[sugarcane]] is called a ''plantation''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:World-map-2004-cia-factbook-large-1.7m-whitespace-removed.jpg|thumb|300px|A map of the Earth]] '''Geography''' is the study of the [[Earth]] and its features, its inhabitants, and its phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geography |work=The American Heritage Dictionary/ of the English Language, Fourth Edition |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/geography |accessdate=October 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''geography'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''gê'' (&quot;Earth&quot;) and ''graphein'' (&quot;to write, draw&quot;). It means &quot;to write and draw about the Earth&quot;. The word was first used by a scientist called [[Eratosthenes]] (276-194 B.C.).

Its features are things like [[continent]]s, [[sea]]s, [[river]]s and [[mountain]]s. Its inhabitants are all the people and [[animal]]s that live on it. Its phenomena are the things that happen like [[tide]]s, [[wind]]s, and [[earthquake]]s.

A person who is an expert in geography is a geographer. A geographer tries to understand the world and the things that are in it, how they started and how they have changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geography: The Mother of Sciences |url=http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081003084542/http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/morgans/lecture_2.prn.pdf |archivedate=3rd October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geography is divided into two main parts called physical geography and human geography. Physical geography studies the natural environment and human geography studies the human environment. The human environmental studies would include things such as the [[population]] in a country, how a country's [[economy]] is doing, and more. There is also environmental geography.

Geographers need to know a lot about [[map]]s because maps are very important for understanding geography. Geographers use maps a lot, and often make them. Making maps is called [[cartography]], and similarly, people who make maps are cartographers.

== Natural environment ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Grammar''' means the rules about how to speak and write in a language. The [[Ancient Greek]]s used to call it ''grammatikē tékhnē'', the [[craft]] of letters. It can have any of these meanings:
# The study of a [[language]]: how it works, and everything about it. This is ''background research on language''.
# The study of [[sentence]] structure. A set of rules and examples to show how the language should be used. This is a ''correct usage grammar'', as in a textbook or manual.
# The system which people learn as they grow up. This is the ''native-speaker's grammar''.&lt;ref name=&quot;McA&quot;&gt;McArthur, Tom (ed) 1992. ''The Oxford companion to the English language. Oxford University Press''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p446&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Crystal&quot;&gt;Crystal, David 1995. ''The Cambridge encyclopedia of the English language''. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p453&lt;/sup&gt;

When we speak, we use the native-person's grammar, or as near as we can. When we write, we try to write with correct grammar. So, speaking and writing a language each have their own style.

== Different languages ==
All languages have their own grammar. Most [[Europe]]an languages are rather similar, but some, such as [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], are very different from all European languages.

English makes few changes to its word endings ('[[suffix]]es'). In the [[Italic]] or 'Romance' languages (such as [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), word endings carry a lot of meaning. In English we have just a few: plurals and possessives (''John's'') are the most common. In our verbs we have dropped most endings except one: I love, you love, but ''she love'''s'''''. That final ''''s'''' is a remnant of [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]], which had more suffixes. Verbs do have endings which show changes in [[Grammatical tense|tense]]: walk'''ed''', walk'''ing'''.

[[Word order]] is the other big difference. Romance languages normally put adjectives after the nouns to which they refer. For example, in English, a person may say ''I like fast cars'', but in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], it is ''Me gustan los coches rápidos''. The order of the words has changed: if just the words, without the grammar, are translated into English, it would mean 'to me they please the cars fast'. This is because Spanish and English have different rules about word order. In [[German language|German]], verbs often come near the end of sentences (as: ''Die Katze hat die Nahrung gegessen.''), whereas in English we usually put them between [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[Object (grammar)|object]], as: ''the cat has eaten the food''.

== Changing language ==
Written grammar changes slowly but spoken grammar is more [[fluid]]. Sentences which English speakers find normal today, might have seemed strange 100 years ago. And they might not, because many of our favourite sayings come from the [[Authorized King James Version]] of the [[Bible]], and from [[Shakespeare]].

Some people use grammar that is different from other people when speaking. For example, people who use what is called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_American General American English] or [[Received Pronunciation|BBC English]] might say, ''I didn't do anything'', while someone who speaks what is called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_American_Vernacular_English African American Vernacular English] or AAVE might say, ''I didn't do nothing''. [[London]] [[working class]] version: ''I ain't done nuffink!'' These are called ''double negatives'', and are found almost entirely in spoken language, not written language.

These differences are called [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialects dialects]. The dialect a person uses is usually decided by where they live. Even though the dialects of English use different words or word order, they still have grammar rules. However, when writing in American English, grammar uses the rules of General American English. When people talk about using 'proper English', they usually mean using the grammar of general British English, as described in standard reference works.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nash&quot;&gt;Nash, Walter 1986. ''English usage: a guide to first principles''. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London. Contains a list of sources.&lt;/ref&gt; The models for ''spoken'' English in Britain are often called [[Received Pronunciation]] or BBC English.

== Syntax ==
Grammar studies [[syntax]] as well as the different parts of language. These are called &quot;parts of speech&quot;. They fit together according to rules and create [[sentence]]s. Sentences fit together and create [[paragraph]]s.

== Parts of speech ==
Grammar studies [[noun]]s, [[pronoun]]s, [[verb]]s, [[adjective]]s, [[adverb]]s, [[preposition]]s, [[conjunction]]s, [[sentence]]s, [[phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, [[interjection]]s. 

=== Nouns ===
Nouns are 'thing' words like 'table and 'chair'. They are [[wikt:object|objects]], things you see in everyday life. Proper nouns are places, people's names, or other things like days of the week. The name 'James' is a proper noun, as is 'Wednesday' and 'London'. Nouns can also be [[abstract]] things, such as 'suffering' or 'happiness'.

=== Verbs ===
Verbs describe [[wikt:action|actions]] and [[wikt:state|states]]. Action: &quot;John threw the ball&quot;. State: &quot;I am worried&quot;. The basic verb form is called the [[infinitive]]. The infinitive for existence is &quot;to be&quot;. A famous example is the speech of [[Hamlet]]: ''To be or not to be, that is the question''.

Variations of the infinitive create [[Verb#Tense|verb tenses]]. 
{{col-begin}}
{{col-3}}
:&lt;big&gt; [[Past tense]] = ''was''&lt;/big&gt;
{{col-3}}
:&lt;big&gt;[[Present tense]] = ''is''&lt;/big&gt;
{{col-3}}
:&lt;big&gt;[[Future tense]] = ''will/shall''&lt;/big&gt;
{{col-end}}

[[File:Great Lakes from space.jpg|thumb|right|230px|View from space of the Great Lakes]]

The '''Great Lakes''' are five large [[lake]]s in east-central [[North America]]. They hold 21% of the world's [[Surface area|surface]] [[fresh water]].&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/glnpo/basicinfo.html |title=Great Lakes – U.S. EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date=2006-06-28 |accessdate=2011-02-19}} Note: by 'surface' is meant 'as measured by [[surface area]]'. Measured by [[volume]] it would no doubt be a lesser figure.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The lakes are:
* [[Lake Superior]]
* [[Lake Michigan]]
* [[Lake Huron]]
* [[Lake Erie]]
* [[Lake Ontario]]

== Geography ==
[[Image:Great Lakes 2.PNG|thumb|right|230px|Great Lakes: system profile]]

Four of the Great Lakes are on the border between [[Canada]] and the [[United States|United States of America]]. The other, Lake Michigan, is completely inside the United States.

All together, by [[volume]], they are the largest group of [[fresh water]] lakes in the world. No one of the Lakes is larger than [[Lake Baikal]] ([[Russia]]) or [[Lake Tanganyika]] ([[East Africa]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biology.usgs.gov/luhna/chap6.html |title=LUHNA Chapter 6: Historical Landcover Changes in the Great Lakes Region |publisher=Biology.usgs.gov |date=2003-11-20 |accessdate=2011-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Fereidoun|last=Ghassemi| year=2007|title=Inter-basin water transfer| publisher=Cambridge, Cambridge University
Press|isbn=0-52-186969-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cities of [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] (9.8 million people, on Lake Michigan), [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] (5.5 million, on Lake Ontario); [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] (5.3 million, on the Detroit river); [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] (3.9 million, on the [[St. Lawrence River]]), [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] (2.9 million, on Lake Eyrie) and [[Ottawa]] (1.2 million, Ontario, on the Ottawa River) are on the shores of the Great Lakes or their rivers.

Though the five lakes have separate basins, they form a single, connected body of freshwater. The lakes connect the east-central interior of North America to the Atlantic Ocean. Water flows from Lake Superior and Lake Michigan into Lake Huron; then through the [[Detroit River]] into Lake Erie; then through [[Niagara Falls]] into Lake Ontario; and then through the [[Saint Lawrence River]] to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Water also drains from the [[Chicago River]] on the south.&lt;ref group=&quot;Note&quot;&gt;The Chicago River originally flowed into Lake Michigan.  The flow was artificially reversed to protect the quality of Chicago's drinking water that comes from Lake Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many rivers flow through a large [[watershed]] into the lakes. The lakes have about 35,000 islands. The Great Lakes region includes the five lakes and many thousands of smaller lakes, often called ''inland lakes''.

Lake Michigan and Lake Huron hit all-time record low levels in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/lakes-michigan-huron-hit-record-low-level-dq8loc2-189903561.html ''Lakes Michigan, Huron hit record low water level''] Feb. 5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The unusual shape of the Great Lakes has created the possibility of large waves called [[seiche]]. If a [[storm]] causes a fast, strong increase in [[air pressure]] on one side of a lake, the water level on that side of the lake will drop and suddenly push up the water level on the opposite side of the lake.  A 10 foot tall wave in Chicago caused several deaths in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/1129.html|title=Seiches|accessdate=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological threats ==
The Great Lakes are home to a variety of species of fish and other organisms. In recent years, [[overfishing]] caused a decline in lake [[trout]]. The drop in lake trout increased the [[alewife]] population. In response, the government introduced [[salmon]] as a predator to decrease the alewife population. This program was so successful that the salmon population rose rapidly, and the states surrounding Lake Michigan promoted 'salmon snagging'. This has been made illegal in all of the Great Lakes states except for a limited season in Illinois. Lake Michigan is now being stocked with several species of fish. However, several invader species such as [[lamprey]]s, [[round goby]], and [[zebra mussel]]s threaten the native fish populations.

=== Invasive species ===
Accidentally [[Invasive species|introduced species]] are a big problem. Since the 19th century about 160 species have invaded the Great Lakes ecosystem, causing severe economic and ecological impacts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISEA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.greatlakeseducation.org/about_isea/?id=204 |title=Our threatened Great Lakes |accessdate=2007-11-30 |publisher=Inland Seas Education Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Inland Seas Education Association, they deprive fish of food, cause blooms of toxic [[algae]], and [[foul]] boats, [[spawn]]ing areas and drinking water intakes. On average a new invasive species enters the Great Lakes every eight months.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISEA&quot; /&gt;

Two important infestations in the Great Lakes are the [[zebra mussel]],  first discovered in 1988, and the [[quagga mussel]] in 1989.{{fact|date=January 2012}} These [[mollusc]]s are efficient filter feeders. They compete with native [[mussel]]s, and also reduce available food and spawning grounds for fish.  

Also, the mussels hurt utility and manufacturing industries by clogging or blocking pipes. The [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] estimates that the economic impact of the zebra mussel will be about $5&amp;nbsp;billion over the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glc.org/ans/ |title=Great Lakes aquatic nuisance species |accessdate=2007-11-30 |publisher=Great Lakes Commission |date=2007-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the quagga mussel is good at filtering [[plankton]] from the lake water, sunlight reaches deeper into the lake. This increases the growth of algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/environment/july-dec11/mussels_11-23.html#transcript|title=Tiny mussels invade Great Lakes, threaten fishing industry|date=November 23, 2011|accessdate=November 23, 2011|work=PBS Newshour}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pollution ===
Chemicals from industrial plants run off the land into rivers and arrive in the lakes. Some of these chemicals are highly [[toxic]], such as [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]. [[Contaminated]] water from [[sewer]] overflows also reaches the lakes, and beaches get closed because of the threat of [[pathogen]]ic [[bacteria]].&lt;ref name=ISEA/&gt;

The '''GNU Free Documentation License''' (GFDL) is a [[copyleft]] [[license]] for [[open content]]. It was made up by the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) for the [[GNU]] project. It was initially created for use with software documentation, but can be applied to other types of works as well, such as [[Wikipedia]]. 

As a [[copyright]] license, the GFDL is a type of [[contract]] between the creator of a copyrightable work (such as a [[book]], an [[encyclopedia]] article, a [[painting]], or a piece of [[music]]) and anyone else who might want to use it. The GFDL is considered &quot;copyleft&quot; because the license is meant to make it easier to use and re-use the copyrighted work, not to restrict its use. 

If a copyrightable work is released under the GFDL, the creator of the work is saying that anyone else may reproduce, distribute, or modify the work, as long as they follow a set of requirements specified in the GFDL. Among the requirements of the GFDL are that any new work created from the original work is also licensed under the GFDL—that is, once something is licensed as GFDL, it will always stay licensed as GFDL, and anything which uses it also is licensed as GFDL. (Because the license &quot;reproduces&quot; and stays with the work, this is sometimes called a &quot;[[virus|viral]]&quot; license.)

The GFDL also says that in order to distribute or modify a work licensed with the GFDL, the re-user must give credit to any previous authors of the work, and include a list of changes they made to the work. 

Finally, any work licensed with the GFDL must contain, somewhere, the entire text of the license. This provision has been criticized, because it is not always easy to include an entire, long license with a copyrighted work. In a book, for example, it is easy to include one extra page with the license, but if the work is something like a song, or a photograph, it is not easy. 

The GFDL has other requirements that are more complicated. For example, if part of the work is labeled as an &quot;invariant section,&quot; it cannot ever be removed or changed by someone using the work (&quot;invariant&quot; means &quot;does not change&quot;). 

Works licensed under the GFDL may be included in with non-GFDL-licensed works only if it is clear which parts of the work are licensed as the GFDL. For example, in a book of poetry it would be easy to label some poems as licensed under the GFDL and some not licensed under it. But it would not be easy to label if part of a song was licensed as GFDL and the rest was not, so this would not be allowed. 

Any use of GFDL material which violates the terms of the GFDL is potentially [[copyright infringement]].

A number of online projects use the GFDL. The largest online project to license its content under the GFDL is [[Wikipedia]].{{fact|date=April 2009}}

The GFDL has been criticized by many people who wish that it made it even easier for content to be re-used. Among the criticisms are that it is very hard to combine GFDL material with other copyleft licenses, that it is not always clear and easy to understand, and that some of its requirements, such as the &quot;invariant sections&quot;, are not free at all.

'''Glass''' is a [[wikt:hard|hard]] [[material]] that can be made in many [[shape]]s. It is usually [[transparency|transparent]], but it can also be made in [[colour]]s. Glass is made of [[sand]] that is heated until it is liquid. When it is liquid, it is shaped and left to cool.

Glass is often used to make [[window]]s and [[bottle]]s. Many [[church]]es have windows made of colored glass.

Glass is used to make [[Lens (optics)|lenses]]. The word &quot;glasses&quot; is often used to mean [[eyeglasses]].

The [[myth]] that glass is actually a liquid comes from the fact that old windows in houses and churches (200–300 years old) are sometimes a little out of shape: thicker at the bottom than the top.  This is actually due to the process of glass making in the past which led to the glass pane being thicker at one edge than the other.  It was sensible to install the windows with the thick edge at the bottom.  Sometimes a window can be found with the thick edge at the top of the window.

Glass can be [[Recycling|recycled]] over and over. Glass bottles and jars can easily be recycled to make new glass bottles and jars or used in industry as aggregate (building material) or sand.

{{complex|date=November 2011}}
[[File:Brahma Halebid.jpg|thumb|[[Brahma]] is the creator god in [[Hinduism]]. Brahma, [[Shiva]] and [[Vishnu]] are the most important Hindu gods. This image shows Brahma on a [[temple]] wall.]] 

[[Abrahamic religion]]s say that there is a [[supernatural]] being called '''God'''. [[Hinduism]] says there is more than one god. [[Theist]]s believe that God created everything that [[wikt:exist|exist]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swinburne&quot;&gt;{{citation |last=Swinburne |first=R.G. |chapter=God |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |quote=...most philosophical theologians... have generally regarded him as a personal being, bodiless, omnipresent, creator and sustainer of any universe there may be, perfectly free, omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good, and a source of moral obligation; who exists eternally and necessarily...}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In most religions, God is believed to be immortal (cannot die), and to have powers to control nature far beyond the powers of humans.

The belief that there is at least one god is usually called [[theism]]. People who reject belief that any deities exist are called [[atheism|atheists]]. [[Agnosticism|Agnostics]] think we cannot know for sure whether any deities exist, but still might (or might not) believe at least one deity exists. People who believe in a god but not in religion are called ''deists''. People who believe that the definition of &quot;''God''&quot; should be defined before taking a theological position are [[Ignosticism|ignostic]].

In some religions there are many [[Deity|gods]]. This is called [[polytheism]]. In other religions, there is only one, which is called [[monotheism]]. In polytheism the word &quot;gods&quot; is usually written in lowercase letters. ''God'' is usually written with an uppercase letter when only one god is believed to exist. Some polytheists also use uppercase when talking about their most important god.

== Does God exist? ==
Many people have asked themselves if God exists. Philosophers, theologians and others have tried to prove that it exists, others have tried to show that it does not exist. In [[Philosophy|philosophical]] terminology, such arguments are about the [[epistemology]] of the [[ontology]] of God. The debate exists mainly in philosophy since science does not address whether or not [[supernatural]] things exist.

There are many philosophical issues with the existence of God. Some definitions of God are not specific.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2002/entries/omnipotence/&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments for the existence of God typically include [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], [[empiricism|empirical]], [[inductive reasoning|inductive]], and subjective types. Some theories are built around holes in [[evolution|evolutionary theory]], as well as order and complexity in the [[world]]. Arguments against the existence of God typically include empirical, [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and inductive arguments. Conclusions sometimes include: &quot;God does not exist&quot; ([[atheism|strong atheism]]); &quot;God almost certainly does not exist&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawkins&quot;&gt;{{cite web 
| last=Dawkins 
| first=Richard 
| authorlink=Richard Dawkins 
| title=Why There Almost Certainly Is No God 
| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-dawkins/why-there-almost-certainl_b_32164.html 
| accessdate=2007-01-10
| publisher=The Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''de facto'' [[atheism]]); &quot;no one knows whether God exists&quot; ([[agnosticism]]); &quot;God exists, but this cannot be proven or disproven&quot; ([[deism]] or [[theism]]); and &quot;God exists and this can be proven&quot; (theism). There are many variations on these positions, and sometimes different names for some of them. For example, the position &quot;God exists and this can be proven&quot; is sometimes called &quot;gnostic theism&quot; or &quot;strong theism&quot;.

==Names==
There are different names for God in different religions. Some examples are [[Allah]] in Islam, [[Yahweh]] or [[Elohim]] in Judaism, [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|Baha]] in Baha'i Faith, [[Waheguru]] in Sikhism, and [[Ahura Mazda]] in Zoroastrianism.

== Believing in God ==
[[File:Europe belief in god.svg|thumb|250px|The percentage of people in European countries who said in 2005 that they &quot;believe there is a God&quot;. Countries with [[Eastern Orthodox]] (i.e.: [[Greece]], [[Romania]], etc.) or [[Muslim]] (Turkey) majorities tend to poll highest.]]
In the year  2000, approximately 53% of the world's population were part of one of the three main Abrahamic religions (33% Christian, 20% Islam,  less than 1% Judaism), 6% with Buddhism, 13% with Hinduism, 6% with [[Chinese folk religion|traditional Chinese religion]], 7% with various other religions, and less than 15% as non-religious. Most of these religious beliefs involve God or gods.&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Family Reference Atlas of the World p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

== God in the Abrahamic religions ==
[[Abrahamic religions]] are very popular monotheistic ones. Well-known Abrahamic religions include [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]].  [[Monotheistic]] means the people in these religions believe there is only one God.  The name of God is usually not allowed to be said in [[Judaism]], but some Jews today call him [[YHWH]] (Yahweh) or Jehovah. [[Muslim]]s say the word [[Allah]], which is the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for &quot;The God.&quot; 

Believers in the Abrahamic religions (except Islamic believers) believe that God has created [[human beings]] in his [[image]] or [[wikt:likeness|likeness]], but this idea is rarely taken literally. The idea of an old man with a beard has been used in art since the [[Renaissance]], but is not what most monotheists actually believe he looks like.

=== God in Christianity ===
{{main|God in Christianity}}
The [[Christian]] [[Bible]] talks about God in different ways. Christians say that the [[Old Testament]] talks about &quot;God the Father&quot;. The [[New Testament]] is about [[Jesus]], or &quot;God the Son&quot;. Many Christians also believe that Jesus was God's [[incarnation]] on earth.  Christians consider the [[Holy Spirit]] to be God as well.

In the [[New Testament]], there are three beings who are said to be God in different forms: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (also known as the Holy Ghost). This is called the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]] by most people who believe in it. Although the word &quot;Trinity&quot; is not in the Bible, the word used for God in chapter one of [[Genesis]] is [[plural]], and the words ' in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit' are used in the [[New Testament]], (e.g. [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 28:19) Another word that most Christians believe means the same thing as &quot;Trinity&quot; is Godhead. 

Some believe that Jesus was just a man that talked about God.Members of the [[Unitarian Church]] have these beliefs.

Christians believe that [[incarnation|God turned into a man]] named [[Jesus]], and came to Earth to save everyone from [[sin]]. When Jesus prayed and talked to God, he called him &quot;Father,&quot; and taught others to do the same.

== God in Eastern religions ==
In [[Hinduism]], there is only one God, named [[Brahman]], but Brahman is said to have taken on many different [[incarnation]]s. Some of these are [[Rama]], [[Krishna]], [[Buddha]], [[Shiva]], [[Kali]], [[Parvati]], and [[Durga]]. To many outsiders, the worship of God's different incarnations is considered to be the worship of many gods. However, it is really only the worship of one God in different ways.

Some Hindus also believe that the spirit of God lives in everyone. This idea is called [[Advaita Vedanta]], which is the Hindu term for [[Monism]].

Religions like [[Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]] involve the worship of many gods, or sometimes no gods at all.

== God in Western philosophy ==
Philosophers can talk about God or god; sometimes they talk about a specific god, but other times they are just talking about the idea of god.

One of the earliest Western philosophers to write about God in a monotheistic way was the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Aristotle]], who describes god as the Supreme Cause. Aristotle saw God as a being that makes everything happen, but is not influenced by anything else.

There are also some philosophical problems with God. One of them is called [[God paradox]]. It is a question about whether (an omnipotent) God can make a mountain that is so heavy he cannot lift it.

A '''ghost''' is considered to be the [[spirit]] of a [[Human death|dead]] person. [[Scientist]]s say that there are no [[reality|real]] ghosts,&lt;ref&gt;Shane McCorristine ''Spectres of the Self: Thinking About Ghosts and Ghost-Seeing in England,1750-1920'' 2010, pp. 44-56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ken Gelder ''The horror reader'' 2000, pp. 43-44&lt;/ref&gt; but many people believe that there are.

There are many [[story|stories]] about ghosts in [[book]]s and [[movie]]s. Sometimes the ghost is the spirit of a person who was killed or who died. The ghost may stay on [[Earth]] because he or she has unfinished problems or is still trying to say good bye to loved ones. Sometimes ghosts are said to live in a particular [[wikt:locality|locality]], for example an abandoned [[house]].

Sometimes the ghosts in these stories exist because of some problem the person had during life or to say good bye to loved ones, that was not solved before he or she died. The ghost stays on the Earth trying to fix the problem. If the problem is fixed, the ghost can leave the Earth. Many people say they have seen or heard ghosts. People who try to talk to ghosts as their job are called [[Medium (spirituality)|mediums]].

There can be bad ghosts and there can also be good ones. There have never been any ghosts that have actually hurt or killed people, although people tell stories about it.

Many people believe they have seen ghosts. Others believe they have felt ghosts near them. Often the ghost is said to appear as a feeling of [[cold]] and a [[light]] or a misty [[cloud]], but sometimes people say they have seen ghosts that look more like people. Sometimes ghosts are said to come in [[human]] form. Some ghosts might cause fear in the person who sees them, by being seen suddenly. Some ghosts are said to be friendly and help people who have problems.

Ghosts are said to form right after they die, or even [[century|centuries]] later. Many people make up stories or urban [[legend]]s. Many try to prove the existence of these paranormal [[creature]]s with special [[technology]] such as heat [[sensor]]s. They also make TV shows dedicated to proving the existence of ghosts. They often investigate cases where a person has seen one or visit a place of sighting.

Stories of ghosts can be found all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The treasures of darkness: a history of Mesopotamian religion |author=Thorkild Jacobsen |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1978 |isbn=0-300-02291-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siu.edu/news/ghosts.html |title=Classical ghost stories |accessdate=2007-09-19 |last=Jaehnig |first=K.C. |date=1999-03-11 |publisher= Southern Illinois University |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070908171955/http://www.siu.edu/news/ghosts.html |archivedate = September 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hawaiian Legends of Ghosts and Ghost-Gods |author=William Drake Westervelt |publisher=Forgotten Books |year=1985 |isbn=1-60506-964-7 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=hVd46sXgkSAC&amp;dq=polynesian+ghost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese philosopher [[Confucius]] said &quot;Respect ghosts and gods, but keep away from them.&quot;&lt;ref name=mincul&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.chinaculture.org/gb/en_chinaway/2004-03/17/content_46337.htm |title=Chinese Ghost Culture |accessdate=2010-07-07 |publisher=Ministry of Culture, P.R.China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green''' is a [[color]].  It is one of the colors of the [[rainbow]]. Green is between the [[yellow]] and [[blue]] colors in a rainbow. Green [[paint]] can be made by mixing yellow paint and blue paint together. 

Green light, like all [[light]], is [[quanta]]--composed of [[photon]]s.  The [[wavelength]] of green light is about 550 [[nanometer]]s (one-billionth of a [[meter]]).

Most [[leaf|leaves]] of growing [[plant]]s, such as [[tree]]s and [[bush]]es, are green. This is because there is a [[chemical]] in [[leaf|leaves]], called [[chlorophyll]], which is colored green.

== Meaning of Green ==
* Green is used as a colour associated with [[jealousy]]. The phrase &quot;green-eyed monster&quot; means a jealous person.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''God's eye view''' is a name for a [[point of view]] where the speaker or writer assumes they have [[knowledge]] only [[God]] would have.  It appears several ways:

*In [[religion]], when an [[institution]] claims to speak for a [[divine being]].

*In [[writing]], when an [[author]] leaves the [[point of view]] of the [[main actor]] to start writing about things they could not know if the story were in real life.

*In [[science]], when a [[scientist]] ignores the way a [[subject-object problem]] affects [[statistics]] or an [[observer effect]] affects [[experiment]].

*In [[medicine]] when the [[Medical doctor|doctor]] makes a claim that [[The Gaze]] he uses on a patient, actually sees the problem, rather than making a guess at a problem.

*In [[ethics]] when a statement is made about who or what is right, without an honest attempt to make the [[wikt:process|process]] of deciding this consider all points of view.

A special case of the last is in a [[wiki]] with a [[GodKing]].  Often this person can get others to believe what they say about what is right, without making any special effort to be fair to other views.

Many people think [[Rene Descartes]] took a God's eye view when he said [[cogito ergo sum]].  [[George Berkeley]] argued that [[optics]] from [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Johannes Kepler]] also had this problem.

[[File:Googleplex-SignIn.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A man signing in at Google's main office, Googleplex.]]
'''Google''' is one of the largest [[search engine]]s on the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW). Search engines also do other things than searching. Other search engines (for example, [[America Online|AOL]]) use its [[software]] and information ([[database]]) too. That makes it the most-used search engine on the web. Every day, 200 million (200,000,000) people use it. Google's main office (&quot;Googleplex&quot;) is in [[Mountain View, California]], [[United States|USA]].

With Google, people can also search for pictures, [[Usenet]] newsgroups, news, and things to buy online. By June [[2004]], Google had 4.28 billion [[web page]]s on its database, 880 million (880,000,000) pictures and 845 million (845,000,000) Usenet messages — six billion things. 

&quot;To google,&quot; as an action word (verb) means &quot;to search for something on Google&quot;. Because Google is so popular (more than half of people on the web use it) it has been used to mean &quot;to search the web&quot;. Google dislikes this use since the name of the company is a [[trademark]].

== History ==
Google was started in early 1996 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, two students at [[Stanford University]], USA. It used to be called Backrub. Later, they made it into a company, Google Inc., on [[September 7]], [[1998]] at a friend's garage in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], [[California]]. In February [[1999]], the company moved to 165 University Ave., [[Palo Alto, California]].  Later that year, it moved to another place, now called the &quot;Googleplex&quot;.

In September 2001, Google's rating system (&quot;PageRank&quot;, for saying which information is more helpful) got a U.S. [[Patent]]. The patent was to Stanford University, with Lawrence (Larry) Page as the [[inventor]] (the person who first had the idea).

Google makes an important, though shrinking, percentage of its money through its friends like [[America Online]] and InterActiveCorp. It has a special group known as the Partner Solutions Organization (PSO) which helps make [[contract]]s, helps making accounts better, and gives engineering help.

==How Google makes money==
Google makes money by [[advertising]]. People or companies who want to make other people visit their website give Google money, and Google shows an advertisement to people Google thinks will click on the advertisement. Google only gets money when people click on the link, so it tries to know as much about people as possible to only show the advertisement to the &quot;right people&quot;. It does this with Google Analytics, which sends data back to Google whenever someone visits a web site. From this and other Data, Google makes a profile about the person, which it then uses to figure out which advertisements to show.

== The name &quot;Google&quot; ==
The name &quot;Google&quot; is a misspelling of the word ''[[googol]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Koller, David. &quot;[http://graphics.stanford.edu/~dk/google_name_origin.html Origin of the name, &quot;Google.&quot;] ''[[Stanford University]].'' January, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hiw &gt;{{citation|title=Google revolution|publisher=Imagine Publishing|newspaper=How it Works|pages=40-43|issue=37|date=2012-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milton Sirotta]], nephew of U.S. mathematician [[Edward Kasner]], made this word in 1938, for the number 1 followed by one hundred zeroes (&lt;math&gt;10^{100}&lt;/math&gt;). It is said that the word &quot;googol&quot; was chosen as a name for this number because it sounded like baby talk. Google uses this word because the company wants to make lots of stuff on the Web easy to find and use. Andy Bechtolsheim first thought of the name. 

The name for Google's main office, the &quot;Googleplex,&quot; is a play on a different, even bigger number, the &quot;[[googolplex]]&quot;, which is 1 followed by one googol of zeroes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''government''' is a group of people that have the [[Influence|power]] to rule in a [[territory]], according to the [[law]]. This territory may be a [[country]], a [[state]] or [[province]] within a country, or a region. 
 
*Governments make [[law]]s, rules, and regulations, collect [[tax]]es and print [[money]]. 
*Governments have systems of [[:wikt:justice|justice]] that list the acts or activities that are against the law and describe the punishments for breaking the law. 
*Governments have a [[police]] force to make sure people follow the laws. 
*Governments have [[diplomacy|diplomats]] who communicate with the governments of other [[country|countries]] by having meetings. Diplomats try to solve problems or disagreements between two countries, which can help countries to avoid war, make commercial agreements, and exchange cultural or social experiences and [[knowledge]]. 
*Governments have a [[military]] force such as an [[army]] that protects the country if other countries attack or which can be used to attack and invade other countries. 
*The [[leader]] of a government and his or her [[advisor]]s are called the [[administration]]. 

== Types of governments ==
=== Democracy ===
The most common type of government in the Western world is called [[democracy]]. In democracies, people in a country can vote during elections for representatives or political parties that they prefer. The people in democracies can elect representatives who will sit on [[legislature]]s such as the [[Parliament]] or [[Congress]]. [[political party|Political parties]] are organizations of people with similar ideas about how a country or region should be governed. Different political parties have different ideas about how the government should handle different problems. Democracy is the government of the people, by the people and for the people. 

However, many countries have forms of democracy which limit freedom of choice by the voters. One of the most common ways is to limit which parties who can for parliament, or limit the parties access to mass media such as television. Another way is to rig the voting system by removing votes from opposition voters and substituting votes for the party in power. Few countries are textbook democracies, and the differences between them has been much studied.&lt;ref&gt;Hoppe, Hans-Hermann. 2001. ''Democracy: the god that failed''. Rutgers, N.J: Transaction. [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/hoppe/hoppe4.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Benoist, Alain de 2011. ''The problem of democracy''. Arktos Media. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Gordon 2002. ''The case against the democratic state: an essay in cultural criticism''. Imprint Academic.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Monarchy ===
A [[monarchy]] is a government ruled by a king or a queen who inherits their position from their family, which is often called the &quot;royal family.&quot; There are two types of monarchies: absolute monarchies and constitutional monarchies. In an absolute monarchy, the ruler has no limits on their wishes or powers. In a [[constitutional monarchy]] a ruler's powers are limited by a document called a [[constitution]].

=== Aristocracy ===
An [[aristocracy]] is a government by the &quot;best&quot; people. A person who rules in an aristocracy is an aristocrat. Aristocracy is different from nobility, in that nobility means that one bloodline would rule, an aristocracy would mean that a few or many bloodlines would rule, or that rulers be chosen in a different manner.

=== Dictatorship ===
Under a [[dictatorship]], the government is run by one person who has all the power over the people in a country. Originally, the [[Roman Republic]] made dictators to lead during time of war. The Roman dictators (and Greek [[tyrant]]s) were not always bad. The Roman dictators only held power for a small time. In modern times, a dictator's rule is not stopped by any laws, constitutions, or other social and political institutions. After World War II, many governments in Latin America, Asia, and Africa were ruled by dictators. Examples of dictators include [[Josef Stalin]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Idi Amin]], [[Muammar al-Qaddafi]], and [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]].

=== Oligarchy ===
An [[oligarchy]] is a government ruled by a small group of powerful people. These people may spread power equally or not equally. An oligarchy is different from a true democracy because very few people are given the chance to change things. An oligarchy does not have to be hereditary or passed down from father to son. An oligarchy does not have one clear ruler, but several powerful people. Some past examples of oligarchy are the former [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] and [[Apartheid]] [[South Africa]]. A fictional example is the [[dystopia]]n society of ''Oceania'' in the book [[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]. Some critics of [[representative democracy]] think of the [[United States]] as an oligarchy. This view is shared by [[anarchism|anarchists]].

== The history and the theory of government ==

The simplest idea of government is those who [[rule]] over [[wikt:people|people]] and [[land]]. This may be as small as a community with some sort of board that looks after the goings on of those who live within it or something a little larger like a [[village]] or as big as a [[continent]] (like [[Australia]] and [[India]]). 

Those people who rule the land can allow others to [[own]] it. It is a [[wikt:deed|deed]] by government that gives this right in the way that [[law]]s describe. Some think they have the right to hold land without government permission. This view is called [[libertarianism]]. Others think they can do so together as a group with others if they live in [[peace]], without government. This view is called [[anarchism]]. 

Almost every place on [[Earth]] is connected to one and only one government. Places without government are where people follow traditions instead of government rules, small [[border dispute]]d areas and the continent of Antarctica, because almost no people live there. For every other place on Earth there is a government that claims 'sovereign control' over it. The word &quot;sovereign&quot; is old and means &quot;control by a [[King]]&quot; ([[sovereign]]). Governments of [[village]]s, [[city|cities]], [[county|counties]] and other [[community|communities]] are also subordinate to the government of the state or province where they exist, and then to that of the [[country]].

It is from Kings and [[feudalism]] that modern governments and [[nation state]]s came. The [[Capital (city)|capital]] of a country, for instance, is where the King kept his [[asset]]s. From this we get the modern idea of [[capital (economics)|capital]] in [[economics]]. A government is said to [[wikt:regulation|regulate]] [[trade]] as well as to rule over land.

Governments also control people and decide things about what [[morality]] to accept or [[punish]]. In very many countries, there are strict rules about [[sexual intercourse]] and [[drug]]s that are part of [[law]] and offenders are punished for disobeying them.

[[Tax]] is how government is paid for in most countries. People who [[buy]], [[sell]], [[import]], [[invest]], own a house or land, or earn money are made to pay some of the [[money]] to a government.

There are many theories of how to organize government better. These are called theories of [[civics]]. Because government is run by people who can be greedy, many people think [[leader]]s must be [[elect]]ed by some kind of [[democracy]]. That way, if government does not act nice, they can be replaced in the next [[election]]. Still many countries' governments are not a [[democracy]] but other forms in which only a few people have power.

There are many theories of how to run a government better, and keep people from hurting each other. These theories are part of [[politics]]. No matter how a government is chosen, it must do politics to keep [[Influence|power]].

This is because the mass within a galaxy holds the galaxy together, and the same applies to the groups of galaxies, such as our [[Local Group]]. The gravitation is produced by the matter and energy in a galaxy or group of galaxies. Everything in a galaxy moves around a [[centre]], and that is also an effect of gravity.  

There are various types of galaxies: [[Elliptical galaxy|elliptical]], [[Spiral galaxy|spiral]] and [[lenticular galaxy|lenticular]] galaxies, which can all be with or without bars. Then there are [[Irregular galaxy|irregular]] galaxies. All galaxies exist inside the [[universe]]. There are probably over 170 billion (1.7x10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;) galaxies within distance we can see or the observable universe.&lt;ref name=Gott&gt;Gott, J. Richard, III; et al. 2005.

==Description==

There are galaxies of different sizes. Typical galaxies range from [[Dwarf galaxy|dwarfs]] with as few as ten million&lt;ref name=cox1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=eso&gt;ESO 2000: [http://www.eso.org/outreach/press-rel/pr-2000/pr-12-00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; (10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;) stars up to giants with a hundred [[trillion]]&lt;ref name=cox1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilford&gt;Wilford, John Noble 1990. &quot;Sighting of largest galaxy hints at clues on the clustering of matter&quot;. ''New York Times''. [http://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/26/us/sighting-of-largest-galaxy-hints-clues-on-the-clustering-of-matter.html. Retrieved 2010-05-06]&lt;/ref&gt; (10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;) stars, all orbiting the galaxy's [[center of mass]]. Galaxies may contain many multiple star systems, [[star cluster]]s, and various [[interstellar cloud]]s. The [[Sun]] is one of the stars in the [[Milky Way]] galaxy; the [[Solar System]] includes the Earth and all the other objects that orbit the Sun.

Star clusters are not galaxies, they are inside galaxies. [[Globular clusters]] are spherical tightly knit balls of stars which are part of the outer [[halo]] of the Milky Way. One of the largest (and oldest) known star clusters, [[Messier 15]], has several million stars, packed closely together, with a [[black hole]] at its centre. The stars are too closely packed to get an accurate count, but it certainly has more stars than some of the smaller galaxies. 

Within [[galaxy cluster]]s, galaxies move relative to other galaxies. They can and do collide. When this happens, the stars generally move past each other, but gas clouds and dust interact, and can form a burst of new stars. Gravity pulls both galaxies into somewhat new shapes, formng bars, rings or tail-like structures.

Many galaxies also continue to form new generations of stars. The Milky Way, and all spiral shaped galaxies like it (see above image of NGC 2997), produce new stars at a rate of one or two stars per year. These stars are formed in the vast interstellar clouds that account for about 1% to 10% of the mass of these galaxies. Globular star clusters, on the other hand, are not currently forming stars because this activity happened billions of years ago and then stopped once all of the gas and dust clouds were used up. 

In the [[astronomy|astronomical]] [[literature]], the word 'Galaxy' with a capital ''G'' is used for our galaxy, the [[Milky Way]]. The billions of other galaxies are just written as 'galaxy' with a lowercase ''g''. The term ''Milky Way'' first came out in the English language in a poem by [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Geometry''' is a kind of [[mathematics]] that studies the [[size]], [[shape]]s, and positions of things. There are [[wikt:flat|flat]] ([[2D]]) shapes and solid ([[3D]]) shapes in geometry.
[[square (geometry)|Squares]], [[circle]]s and [[triangle]]s are some of the simplest shapes in flat geometry. [[Cube]]s, [[cylinder]]s, [[cone]]s and [[sphere]]s are simple shapes in solid geometry.

== Uses ==
Geometry can be used to [[measure]] the [[area]] and [[perimeter]] of a flat shape. It can also be used to measure a [[solid]] shape's [[volume]] and [[surface area]].

Geometry can be used to calculate the size and shape of many things. For example, geometry can help people find: 
* the surface area of a [[house]], so they can buy the right amount of [[paint]] 
* the [[volume]] of a [[box]], to see if it is big enough to hold a [[litre]] of [[food]]
* the area of a [[farm]], so it can be divided into equal parts
* the [[distance]] around the [[edge]] of a [[pond]], to know how much [[fence|fencing]] to [[buy]].

== Origins ==
Geometry began as the art of [[measure|measuring]] the shape of [[land]] so that it could be shared fairly between people. The word &quot;geometry&quot; means &quot;to measure the land&quot;. It has grown from this to become one of the most important parts of mathematics. The [[ancient Greece|Greek]] [[mathematician]] [[Euclid]] wrote the first book about geometry. Geometry is one of the oldest branches of mathematics.

== Examples ==
Geometry starts with a few simple ideas that are thought to be true, called axioms. Such as:

*A '''[[point (geometry)|point]]''' is shown on [[paper]] by [[touch]]ing it with a [[pencil]] or [[pen]], without making any [[sideways]] movement. We know where the point is, but it has no [[size]].

*A '''[[straight]] [[line]]''' is the [[short]]est [[distance]] between two points. For example, Sophie pulls a piece of [[wikt:string|string]] from one point to another point. A straight line between the two points will follow the [[wikt:path|path]] of the tight string.

*A '''[[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]''' is a flat [[surface]] that does not [[wikt:stop|stop]] in any [[direction]]. For example imagine a wall that extends in all directions infinitely.

'''Graph theory''' is a field of [[math]]ematics about graphs. A [[graph]] is an [[abstract]] representation of: A number of [[point (geometry)|point]]s are connected by [[line]]s. Each point is usually called a ''vertex'' (more than one are called ''vertices''), and the lines are called ''edges''.  Graphs are a tool for modelling relationships. They are used to find answers to a number of problems.

Some of these questions are:
* What is the best way for a [[mailman]] to get to all of the [[house]]s in the area in the least amount of [[time]]? The points could represent [[street]] corners and lines could represent the houses along the street. (see [[Chinese postman problem]])

* A salesman has to visit different customers, but wants to keep the distance traveled as small as possible. The problem is to find a way so they can do it. This problem is known as [[Travelling Salesman Problem]] (and often abbreviated ''TSP''). It is among the hardest problems to solve. If a commonly believed [[conjecture]] is true (described as '''P''' ≠ '''NP'''), then an exact solution requires one to try all possible routes to find which is shortest.

* How many colors would be needed to color a map, if countries sharing a border are colored differently? The points could represent the different areas and the lines could represent that two areas are neighboring. (look at the [[Four color theorem]])

* Can a sketch be drawn in one closed line? The lines of the drawing are the lines of the graph and when two or more lines collide, there is a point in the graph. The task is now to find a way through the graph using each line one time. (look at [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]])

== Different kinds of Graphs ==
[[File:Directed.svg|125px|thumb|A directed graph.]]
*Graph theory has many aspects. Graphs can be directed or undirected. An example of a directed graph would be the system of roads in a city. Some streets in the city are one way streets. This means, that on those parts there is only one direction to follow.
*Graphs can be weighted. An example would be a road network, with distances, or with [[toll]]s (for roads).
*The nodes (the circles in the schematic) of a graph are called [[vertex|vertices]]. The lines connecting the nodes are called [[edge]]s. There can be no line between two nodes, there can be one line, or there can be multiple lines.

==History==
{{complex|date=May 2012}}
[[File:Konigsberg bridges.png|thumb|200px|The Königsberg Bridge problem, on a city map]]
[[File:Königsberg_graph.svg|thumb|200px|The same problem, but using a graph]]

[[Leonhard Euler]] used to live in a city that was called ''Königberg'' for some time. (The city has been called [[Kaliningrad]] since 1946). The city is situated on the river Pregel. There is an island in the river, and there are a number of bridges across the river. Euler loved to go for walks, so he asked himself, whether it was possible to do a walk, use each of the bridges once, and come back to the point where he started. In 1736, he published a scientific article where he showed that this was not possible. Today, this problem is known as the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]]. The article is seen as the first paper in the history of graph theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biggs&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Biggs, N.; Lloyd, E. and Wilson, R.|title=Graph Theory, 1736-1936|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

This article, as well as the one written by [[Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde|Vandermonde]] on the ''[[Knight's tour|knight problem]],'' carried on with the ''analysis situs'' initiated by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Euler's formula was about the number of edges, vertices, and faces of a [[convex]] [[polyhedron]] was studied and generalized by [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Cauchy&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cauchy, A.L.|year=1813|title=Recherche sur les polyèdres - premier mémoire|journal=Journal de l'Ecole Polytechnique|volume= 9 (Cahier 16)|pages=66–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Simon Antoine Jean L'Huillier|L'Huillier]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Lhuillier&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=L'Huillier, S.-A.-J.|title=Mémoire sur la polyèdrométrie|journal=Annales de Mathématiques|volume=3|year=1861|pages=169–189}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is at the origin of [[topology]].

Over a century after Euler, [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] studied a special class of graphs, called the ''[[tree (graph theory)|trees]]. A tree is a graph where there is only one path between two vertices.  Cayley tried to solve a problem from [[differential calculus]]. His solution influenced the development of theoretical [[chemistry]]. The technique he used mainly focused on listing all graphs which had certain properties. Today, this is called ''Enumerative graph theory''. It developed from Cayleys results, a scientific publication done by  [[George Pólya|Pólya]] between 1935 and 1937 and the generalization of these by [[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn|De Bruijn]] in 1959. Cayley linked his results on trees with the contemporary studies of chemical composition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cayley1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cayley, A.|year=1875|journal=Berichte der deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft|title=Ueber die Analytischen Figuren, welche in der Mathematik Bäume genannt werden und ihre Anwendung auf die Theorie chemischer Verbindungen|volume=8|pages=1056–1059|doi=10.1002/cber.18750080252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fusion of the ideas coming from mathematics with those coming from chemistry is at the origin of a part of the standard terminology of graph theory. In particular, the term &quot;graph&quot; was introduced by [[James Joseph Sylvester|Sylvester]] in an article published in 1878 in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sylvester&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sylvester, J.J.|year=1878|journal=Nature|title=Chemistry and Algebra|volume=17|pages=284|doi=10.1038/017284a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous and productive problems of graph theory is the [[four color problem]]: &quot;Is it true that any map drawn in the plane may have its regions colored with four colors, in such a way that any two regions having a common border have different colors?&quot; This problem was first posed by [[Francis Guthrie]] in 1852 and its first written record is in a letter of [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]] addressed to [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]] the same year. Many incorrect proofs have been proposed, including those by Cayley, [[Alfred Bray Kempe|Kempe]], and others. The study and the generalization of this problem by [[Peter Guthrie Tait|Tait]], [[Percy John Heawood|Heawood]], [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] and [[Hugo Hadwiger|Hadwiger]] led to the study of the colorings of the graphs embedded on surfaces with arbitrary [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]].  Tait's reformulation generated a new class of problems, the ''factorization problems'', particularly studied by [[Julius Petersen|Petersen]] and [[Dénes Kőnig|Kőnig]]. The works of Ramsey on colorations and more specially the results obtained by [[Pál Turán|Turán]] in 1941 was at the origin of another branch of graph theory, ''[[extremal graph theory]]''.

The four color problem remained unsolved for more than a century. A proof produced in 1976 by [[Kenneth Appel]] and [[Wolfgang Haken]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AA1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Appel, K. and Haken, W.|title=Every planar map is four colorable. Part I. Discharging|journal=Illinois J. Math.|volume=21|year=1977|pages=429–490}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AA2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Appel, K. and Haken, W.|title=Every planar map is four colorable. Part II. Reducibility|journal=Illinois J. Math.|volume=21|year=1977|pages=491–567}}&lt;/ref&gt; which involved checking the properties of 1,936 configurations by computer, was not fully accepted at the time due to its complexity. A simpler proof considering only 633 configurations was given twenty years later by [[Neil Robertson (mathematician)|Robertson]], [[Paul Seymour (mathematician)|Seymour]], [[Daniel Sanders (mathematician)|Sanders]] and [[Robin Thomas (mathematician)|Thomas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RSST&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Robertson, N.; Sanders, D.; Seymour, P. and Thomas, R.|title=The four color theorem|journal=Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B|volume=70|year=1997|pages=2–44|doi=10.1006/jctb.1997.1750}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The autonomous development of topology from 1860 and 1930 fertilized graph theory back through the works of [[Camille Jordan|Jordan]], [[Kazimierz Kuratowski|Kuratowski]] and [[Hassler Whitney|Whitney]]. Another important factor of common development of graph theory and topology came from the use of the techniques of modern algebra. The first example of such a use comes from the work of the physicist [[Gustav Kirchhoff]], who published in 1845 his [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] for calculating the [[voltage]] and [[Electric current|current]] in [[electric circuit]]s.

== Graph theory in perspective ==
Graph theory is an important part of mathematics and computer science. To many such problems, exact solutions do exist. Many times however, they are very hard to calculate. Therefore, very often, [[approximation]]s are used. There are two kinds of such approximations, [[Monte-Carlo algorithm]]s and [[Las-Vegas algorithm]]s.

Graphs are normally represented by two different sets, typically set a graph G would be represented as the collection of the sets V and E. The set V is a discrete set containing all vertices of the graph. The set E is a binary set, whose pairwise elements are elements of set V. Each pair in set E represents an edge connecting two vertices.

If every two nodes have an edge between them, then the graph is called the ''complete graph''.

'''Herm''' is the [[small]]est of the [[Channel Islands]] that is open to the public.

Herm is only 1½ miles long. [[Car]]s are banned from the small [[island]] just like its Channel Island neighbour, [[Sark]]. Unlike Sark, [[bicycle]]s are banned too. The sandy white beaches make Herm a walker's paradise.

Population: 60 (2002)

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''History''' is the [[study]] of past events. People know what happened in the past by looking at [[wikt:thing|things]] ''from'' the past, including records (like [[book]]s, [[newspaper]]s and [[letter]]s) and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] (like [[pottery]], [[tool]]s, and human or animal remains). [[Library|Libraries]], [[archive]]s and [[museum]]s collect and keep these things for people to study history. A person who studies history is called a [[historian]]. A person who studies [[pre-history]] and history through things left behind by ancient cultures is called an [[archaeologist]]. A person who studies [[mankind]] and [[society]] is called an [[anthropologist]]. The study of the sources and methods ''used to study and write'' history is called [[historiography]].

People can learn about the past by talking to people who remember things that happened in the past. This is called [[oral history]]. When people who had been [[slavery|slaves]] and [[American Civil War]] [[survivor]]s got old, some historians recorded everything that they said, so that history would not be lost. 

People in different parts of the world continue to remember events differently, just as in [[Medieval]] [[Europe]], [[Ancient Rome]] and [[Ancient China]] each thought that they ruled the only important parts of the world and that other parts were &quot;[[barbarian]]&quot;.

== Aspects of health ==

===Physical health===
Physical fitness refers to good [[human body|body]] health, and is the result of regular [[exercise]], proper [[diet]] and [[nutrition]], and proper rest for physical [[wikt:recovery|recovery]]. A person who is physically fit will be able to walk or run without getting breathless and they will be able to carry out the activities of everyday living and not need help. How much each person can do will depend on their age and whether they are a man or woman. A physically fit person usually has a normal weight for their height. The relation between their height and weight is called their [[Body Mass Index]]. A taller person can be heavier and still be fit. If a person is too heavy or too thin for their height it may affect their health. &lt;ref&gt; Centers For disease Control and Prevention  http://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/effects/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental health===
Mental health refers to a person's [[emotion]]al and [[psychology|psychological]] well-being. &quot;A state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her thinking and emotional (feeling) abilities, [[wikt:function|function]] in [[society]], and meet the [[wikt:ordinary|ordinary]] demands of everyday life.&quot;

One way to think about mental health is by looking at how well a person functions. Feeling [[wikt:capable|capable]] and [[wikt:efficient|efficient]]; being able to handle normal levels of [[Stress (medicine)|stress]], have good friends and family, and lead an [[wikt:independent|independent]] life; and being able to &quot;bounce back,&quot; or [[wikt:recover|recover]] from hardships, are all signs of mental health.

===Public health===
{{Main|Public health}}
[[Public health]] refers to trying to stop a [[disease]] that is unhealthy to the community, and does not help in long life or promote your health. This is fixed by organized efforts and choices of society, public and private clubs, communities and individuals.

It is about the health of many people, or everybody, rather than one person. Public health stops instead of encouraging a disease through [[Disease surveillance|surveillance]] of cases. To prevent being sick, it is good to do healthy behaviors such as [[hand washing]], [[vaccination]] programs and using [[condom]]s. When [[infectious disease]]s break out, washing hands may be especially important.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Piraeus harbor 3-2004.JPG|thumb|Ship harbor in [[Greece]]]]

'''Harbour''' means to shelter or keep safe. A '''harbor''' (or '''harbour''') is a place where [[ship]]s may shelter. A [[port]] is also a harbour, but is usually bigger. The port will often contain a [[water]] space with wave breakers around the edge, a number of quays or [[pier]]s where the ships may be moored or tied up and a [[transport]] system for taking goods inland. Often [[railway]] and [[road transport]] will be used. Other ways that goods can be moved are [[pipeline transport]] and by using smaller ships on rivers.

During the [[D-Day]] operations of [[1944]], two {{broken wikt link|artificial|artificial}} harbours (named [[Mulberry harbour|mulberry]]) were built just off the [[beach]]es where the invasion was going to happen.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page tells you '''how to edit''' (change) or make new pages on Wikipedia. Anyone can make pages. If you are learning how to make pages, or just want to test an idea, it is a good idea to begin in the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|Sandbox]].

Click on &quot;change this page&quot; at the top of any page, then you can write in the large edit box that will appear. 

The &quot;Change summary&quot; box you will see at the bottom of that page is used to tell others what you are changing or trying to do. For example, if you are writing a new article about dogs, you can put &quot;new article about dogs&quot; in the change summary.

You can also press &quot;Show preview&quot; to see what the page will look like before anyone else does, and check for mistakes. When you are all ready, and you want to send the page, press &quot;'''Save Page'''&quot; - and like that your page is on Wikipedia!

To make a new page, find or make a &quot;red link&quot; with the article name on Wikipedia, for example [[poodle]], if you want to write about poodles.

You can also write the page name in the &quot;search&quot; box in the sidebar to the left on every page, then click &quot;'''Go'''&quot;. If there is no page already with that exact name, the search results page will say: &quot;'''There is no page titled [PAGENAME]'''. You can [[create this page]]&quot;. From that page, just click on the redlink that says &quot;create this page&quot; to get to the &quot;edit box&quot; and make a new page. 

You can also create a new article from this page by typing its name in the box below:

{| width=&quot;60%&quot; style=&quot;border:1px solid black&quot;
|
&lt;inputbox&gt;
type=create
width=45
&lt;/inputbox&gt;
|}

The page name should be ''singular'', for example &quot;Poodle&quot; not &quot;Poodles&quot;. The first letter will automatically be capitalized (upper case) in the title, whether you give it a capital or not.  If there are two or more words in the title, they should be capitalized only if it is a proper name, for example &quot;Elvis Presley&quot; not &quot;Elvis presley&quot;. If the words are not a proper name, do not use capital letters, for example &quot;Big cat&quot; not &quot;Big Cat&quot;.

In the first sentence of the new page you make, write the name of the page in '''bold''' writing.

==Making an encyclopedia page==
{{see also|Help:Cheatsheet}}
===Bold text===

:These words are in &quot;bold&quot; (heavy) text: '''one, two, three'''

To make text bold, use three [[apostrophes]] (') before and after the word.
(An apostrophe is also called a single quote or an inverted comma.)

For example: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;'''Bold text'''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; = '''Bold text'''

===Italics===

:These words are in &quot;italics&quot; (slanted): ''one, two, three''

To make text in italics, use two apostrophes (') before and after the word.
&lt;br&gt;
For example: &lt;nowiki&gt;''Italic text''&lt;/nowiki&gt; = ''Italic text''

===Links to other Wikipedia pages===

To make a link to another Wikipedia page, put the name of the page inside two square brackets ([[).
&lt;br&gt;
For example: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[London]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; = [[London]]

You can also make different words appear, other than the actual name of the linked article: &lt;br&gt;
[[London|The wonderful city of London]] (this link is also to &quot;London&quot;). 
To do this, write: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[London|The wonderful city of London]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Other letters added to the actual link will automatically appear as part of the link, like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;There are three [[London]]s &lt;/nowiki&gt; =  There are three [[London]]s.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;[[London]]ers&lt;/nowiki&gt; = [[London]]ers.

===Links to other language Wikipedia pages===

On the left sidebar are links &quot;in other languages&quot;, for example German (&quot;Deutsch&quot;) and Catalan (Català). The links are for the same article but in a different language. These links are updated from [[Wikidata]].

===Links to other pages not on Wikipedia===

To make a link to other websites that are not on Wikipedia, write the address inside one square bracket ([), then after a single space, you can write a name for the page, then you have to close the word again with another bracket: ].
&lt;br /&gt;
For example: &lt;nowiki&gt;[http://www.google.co.uk Google]&lt;/nowiki&gt; = [http://www.google.co.uk Google]
&lt;br /&gt;

To link to the [[Simple English Wiktionary]] for a word, write &lt;nowiki&gt;[[wikt:wantedword|wantedword]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  (Note that &lt;nowiki&gt;[[wiktionary:wantedword|wantedword]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; links to the EN Wiktionary instead.)
For example: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[wikt:alternate|alternate]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives [[wikt:alternate|alternate]].

===Minor (very small) edits (changes)===

When you save a page you can also say it is a &quot;minor (small) change&quot;. This means a very small change, for example changing one or two words. When you look at [[Special:Recentchanges|Newest changes]], you can choose if you want to see all the changes marked '''m''' for 'minor', or hide them.

It is not right to make a big change and mark it as a 'minor (small) change'. If this happens, it is best to explain that it was a mistake.

===Section headings===

The page you are reading now, &quot;How to edit&quot;, has headings (titles). The first heading is &quot;Making an encyclopedia page&quot;. Under that heading there is a smaller heading (a 'subheading'): &quot;Bold text&quot;.

To make a big heading, write it in this way:

&lt;nowiki&gt;==Big heading==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

To make a smaller heading, write it in this way:

&lt;nowiki&gt;===Smaller heading===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

To make an even smaller heading, write it in this way:

&lt;nowiki&gt;====Even smaller heading====&lt;/nowiki&gt;

When you make four or more headings, Wikipedia automatically makes a table of contents - a list of all the headings - at the start of the page. You do not need to make the table, you only need to make the headings. Do not start the page by writing a heading. Write some general information first.

===Lists===

This is a list:
:* Dogs
:* Cats
:* Birds

To make a list, write it in this way:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;* Dogs&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;* Cats&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;* Birds&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt;

You can make lists in other lists:
:* Dogs
:** big dogs
:***german shepherds
:** small dogs
:*** poodles

Write different lists in this way:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;* Dogs&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;** big dogs&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;*** german shepherds&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;** small dogs&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;*** poodles&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;br&gt;

===Making a space at the start of a line===

You can also make a space at the start of a line, like this:

Dogs
:big dogs
:small dogs
Cats

You can make a space in this way:

&lt;nowiki&gt;:big dogs&lt;/nowiki&gt;

If you write more colons (:) there will be more spaces, like this:

Hi!
:Hi!
::Hi!
:::Hi!
::Hi!
:Hi!
Hi!

===Putting text in the centre of the page===
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;This text is in the centre.&lt;/center&gt;

You can put text in the centre in this way:

&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;center&gt;This is in the centre&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The code must use the American spelling (center) and not the British (centre), or it will not work.

===Making a line across the page===

Here is a line going across the page:

----

You can make a line with four hyphens (dashes), in this way:

&lt;nowiki&gt;----&lt;/nowiki&gt;

==What are talk pages?==

One example of a talk page is [[Talk:Light]]. On that page, people are talking about the article [[Light]]. On a talk page, we talk to other people about the Wikipedia articles. 

If you have a problem with a page and you want to talk about it, click on &quot;talk&quot; at the top of the page.

When you write on a talk page, write your name. You can write your name automatically; write three tildes (~):

for example: &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; = [[User:Saintswithin|Saintswithin]]

When you write four tildes, you also get the time:

for example: &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; = [[User:Saintswithin|Saintswithin]] 21:45, 8 Oct 2004 (UTC)

When you write five tildes, you get just the time, without your name:

for example: &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; = 14:23, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

'''Hawaii''' is a [[U.S. state]]; the only one which is in [[Oceania]]. It is the last state which joined the United States. Hawaii became a state on August 21, 1959.  It is the only state made only of [[island]]s. Hawaii is also the name of the largest island. The [[Capital (city)|capital]] and largest city of Hawaii is [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]] on the island named [[Oahu]].

Hawaii is known as the &quot;Aloha State&quot;. ''Aloha'' is a [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] word that has many meanings like welcome, hello and goodbye.  Aloha also means love and care. The different meanings are brought together in the term &quot;Aloha Spirit&quot; to describe the friendly people of Hawaii.

The state [[flower]] is the yellow [[hibiscus]] (''Hibiscus brackenridgei'' or {{lang|haw|ma'o hau hele}}). The state [[bird]] is the [[Nene|Hawaiian goose]] (nene). The state [[fish]] is the [[reef triggerfish]], also called the ''{{lang|haw|humu humu nuku nuku apua'a}}''. The state [[tree]] is the [[candlenut]], also called ''kukui''. The state [[song]] is [[Hawaii Ponoi]]. The state [[:wikt:motto|motto]] is ''{{lang|haw|Ua mau ke ea o ka aina i ka pono}}''.  In English it says, ''The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness''.

The first people of Hawaii were [[Polynesians]]. They came to the islands sometime between 200 and 600 AD. [[Captain]] [[James Cook]] is given [[credit]] for discovering the islands for the Europeans in 1778. Others may have been there before him. Captain Cook named the islands the Sandwich Islands for the fourth Earl of Sandwich, [[John Montague]].

[[Kamehameha I]] was the first [[king]] of Hawaii. He united the separate small Hawaiian kingdoms into one large kingdom in 1795. In 1893, American soldiers stopped Queen [[Liliuokalani]] from leading Hawaii when American business people took over the government and made their own laws.  She was the last [[monarch]] of Hawaii. She also wrote the original words of the song called ''Aloha Oe''.

The American business people made Hawaii into a [[republic]] for a short time.  The new leader, [[Sanford Dole]] was called the President of Hawaii.  In 1898, the United States of America took over the government and made Hawaii into a [[territory]]. In 1959, Hawaii became the fiftieth American state.

Hawaii is an [[archipelago]]; a long chain of islands. There are eight main islands and many small islands and [[atoll]]s. They are the tops of underwater [[volcano]]s. The main islands are [[Niihau]], [[Kauai]], [[Oahu]], [[Molokai]], [[Lanai]], [[Kahoolawe]], [[Maui]] and [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii]].

The biggest [[industry]] of Hawaii is [[tourism]]. Almost 7 [[million]] people visited in 2000. Important [[export]]s are [[sugar]], [[pineapple]], [[macadamia nut]]s, and [[coffee]].

Popular [[tourist site]]s include [[Waikiki Beach]], [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park]], [[Polynesian Cultural Center]], and the [[USS Arizona Memorial]] at [[Pearl Harbor]].

'''Honolulu''' is the [[capital (city)|capital]] [[city]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Hawaii]]. It is also the largest city in Hawaii and it has the most important [[harbor]]. It is on the south-east shore of the island of [[Oahu]].

==Etymology==
Honolulu means &quot;sheltered harbor&quot; in the Hawaiian language. No one knows for sure when Honolulu was first settled or when the name was first used.

==History==
Honolulu harbor was called Kulolia before foreigners came. The first foreigner was Captain William Brown of the English ship Butterworth, in 1794. He named the harbor Fair Haven. Other foreign captains started calling it Brown's Harbor. The name Honolulu was used some time after that.

Honolulu quickly became the most important harbor of Hawaii. At that time, [[sandalwood]] was a big export. Honolulu was also an important supply point for [[whaler]]s.

Kamehameha III made Honolulu the capital city of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] in 1850. It was also the capital of the [[Republic of Hawaii]] and the [[Territory of Hawaii]]. It stayed the capital when Hawaii became a state in 1959.

==Notable people==
*[[Ferdinand Marcos]], President of the Philippines from 1965 to 1986, died in Honolulu
*[[Bruno Mars]], singer, was born in Honolulu
*[[Barack Obama]], 44th [[President of the United States]], was born in Honolulu
*[[Nicole Scherzinger]], singer, was born in Honolulu
*[[Jason Momoa]], Actor currently lives in Honolulu

The '''Island of Hawaiʻi''' is the largest of the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Hawaiian Islands]], and the southern.  Called locally the &quot;Big Island,&quot; its area is 4,038 sq. miles (10 458 square kilometers).  The widest part of the island is 93 miles (150 km) across.      
The Big Island makes up more than half (~62%) of the total land area of the  [[Hawaii|State of Hawaii]] and is governed by the [[Hawaii County, Hawaii|County of Hawaii]].

The island is built from seven separate [[shield volcano]]s that erupted more or less one at a time, one partly covering the other. The later volcanoes mostly buried two of the earlier ones. These are (from oldest to youngest): [[Kohala]] ([[extinct volcano|extinct]]), Ninole (extinct, mostly buried), [[Mauna Kea]] ([[Dormant volcano|dormant]]), [[Hualalai]] (dormant), [[Mauna Loa]] ([[Active volcano|active]]), Kulani (extinct, mostly buried), and [[Kilauea]] (very active). The volcanos, and the islands, were the result of the Pacific oceanic [[tectonic]] plate moving over a [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspot]]. There [[lava]] from the Earth's lower [[Earth's mantle|mantle]] or upper [[Earth's core|core]] is close to the surface.

The largest city on the island is [[Hilo]]. Hilo is filled with historic buildings, interesting shops, parks and has a constant stream of performances, festivals and events. It is on the rainy east side of the [[island]]. The city of [[Kailua-Kona]] is on the [[:wikt:dry|dry]] west side of Hawaii, and is popular with [[tourists]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Healing''' is a process that happens in the [[body]]. Through healing, [[cell]]s are able to repair damaged [[Tissue (biological)|tissue]].
There are two different ways healing can happen:
* The damaged tissue is replaced with tissue of the same kind. This is called ''regeneration''.
* The damaged tissue is replaced with [[scar]] tissue. This is called ''repair''

Most healing processes combine both ways of healing.

People have lived in [[Australia]] for about 40,000–60,000 years. The first people who arrived in what is now Australia were the [[Australian Aborigines]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dfat.gov.au&quot;&gt;[http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/history.html Australia in Brief: Ancient heritage, modern society – Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]&lt;/ref&gt; Aborigines came by [[boat]] from the [[island]]s of what is now [[History of Indonesia|Indonesia]]. They lived in all parts of Australia. Their lives were simple, they had very few needs. They lived by [[hunting]], [[fishing]] and gathering food. They lived in [[Band (anthropology)|bands]], and they spoke many different [[language]]s.

Aborigines invented tools like the [[boomerang]] and spear, but did not farm. Tradition was very important in their lives. Their religion is called the [[Dreaming]], which has lots of stories about the creation of the world by spirits. [[Aboriginal art]] started at least 30,000 years ago and there are lots of Dreaming stories painted on walls and cut in rocks all around Australia. [[Australian Aboriginal music|Aboriginal music]] has songs about the Dreamtime, sometimes with special instruments like the [[didgeridoo]].

==First European explorers==
In 1606 the first European, [[Netherlands|Dutch]] explorer [[Willem Janszoon]] (1571–1639), visited the west coast of [[Cape York Peninsula]] in [[Queensland]]. A Spanish explorer, [[Luis Vaez de Torres]] sailed through the water between Australia and [[Papua New Guinea]] later that year.{{fact|date=November 2014}} 
Only after Dirk Hartog chanced upon the west coast in 1616 did other European vessels visit and map the coast. After sixty more ships visited the coast,{{fact|date=November 2014}} enough was known for a map to be published in 1811.  The land was dry because of not much rain; some was a [[desert]]. The explorers thought no [[crop]]s could be grown and so it would be difficult for people to live there. They decided there would be no [[economic]] reasons to stay. 

In 1642, Dutchman [[Abel Tasman]], working for the [[Dutch East Indies Company]] reached [[Tasmania]], which he called [[Antony van Diemenslandt]]. He then called the continent he charted the north coast of on his second visit in 1644 [[New Holland]]. In 1688, the privateer [[William Dampier]] became the first Englishman to reach Australia. But in 1770 a British sailor, Captain [[James Cook]], found the fertile east coast of Australia. He called it [[New South Wales]], and claimed it for Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;dfat.gov.au&quot;/&gt;
Englishman [[Matthew Flinders]] published his map of the coast in 1814, calling it [[Australia]] for the first time, a name later formally adopted by the authorities.

==Colonial Australia==

[[File:Adelaide North Tce 1839.jpg|thumb|Adelaide in 1839. [[South Australia]] was founded as a free-colony, without convicts.]]
[[File:Victoria Parliament House Melbourne.jpg|thumb|The Parliament of Victoria, in [[Melbourne]].]]

The British decided to use the land visited by [[Captain Cook]] as a prison colony. Britain needed a place to send its [[convict]]s (people who had been sent to [[jail]] for [[theft]] and other [[crime]]s) because its [[gaol]]s were full and it had just lost its American colonies in the [[American War of Independence]]. In 1788 the British [[First Fleet]] of 11 ships, carrying about 1500 people arrived at [[Sydney]]. [[Arthur Phillip]] led them as the first [[Governor of New South Wales]]. About 160 000 convicts were brought to Australia from 1788 until 1868. Free immigrants began arriving in the 1790s.&lt;ref name=&quot;dfat.gov.au&quot;/&gt;

For the first few years they did not have much [[food]], and life was very hard. But soon they began to [[farm]], and more people came. Sydney grew, and new towns were started. [[Wool]] brought good money. By 1822, many towns had been set up and people from the towns often visited Sydney for additional economic resources.

Soon people from [[Sydney]] found other parts of Australia. [[George Bass]] and [[Matthew Flinders]] sailed south to [[Tasmania]] and a colony was started at [[Hobart]] in 1803. [[Hamilton Hume]] and [[William Hovell]] went south from Sydney by land. They found the [[Murray River]], and good land in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. [[Thomas Mitchell]] went inland, and found more rivers. In 1826, the first [[British military]] outpost was set up at [[King George Sound]] in [[Western Australia]]. The [[Swan River Colony]] was started in 1829, with townsites at [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. In 1836, a free-settler colony was started in [[South Australia]], where no convicts were ever sent. [[Queensland]] became a separate colony in 1859. As the towns and farms spread across Australia, the Aboriginal people were pushed off their land. Some were [[kill]]ed, and many [[die]]d from [[disease|illness]] and hunger. Soon, Australia's Aborigines were outnumbered by Europeans, and many were made to live on reserves.

The goldrushes of New South Wales and Victoria started in 1851 leading to large numbers of people arriving to search for gold. The population grew across south east Australia and made great wealth and industry. By 1853 the goldrushes had made some poor people very rich.

Convict transportation ended in the 1840s and 1850s and more changes came. The people in Australia wanted to run their own country, and not be told what to do from London. The first governments in the colonies were run by Governors chosen by London. Soon the settlers wanted local government and more democracy. The [[New South Wales Legislative Council]], was created in 1825 to advise the [[Governor of New South Wales]], but it was not chosen by voters. [[William Wentworth]] established the [[Australian Patriotic Association]] (Australia's first political party) in 1835 to demand [[Parliamentary democracy|democratic government]] for New South Wales. In 1840, the [[Adelaide City Council]] and the [[Sydney City Council]] were started and some people could vote for them (but only men with a certain amount of money). Then, Australia's first [[parliament]]ary elections were held for the New South Wales Legislative Council in 1843, again with some limits on who could vote. ''The Australian Colonies Government Act'' [1850] allowed constitutions for New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/righttovote.htm The Right to Vote in Australia – Australian Electoral Commission]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1850 elections for legislative councils were also held in the colonies of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/reform.htm Australia’s major electoral developments Timeline: 1788 – 1899 – Australian Electoral Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1855, limited self government was granted by London to New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. A new [[secret ballot]] was introduced in Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia in 1856, allowing people to vote in private. This system was copied around the world. In 1855, the [[right to vote]] was given to all men over 21 in [[South Australia]]. The other colonies soon followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; Women were given the vote in the [[Parliament of South Australia]] in 1895 and they became the first women in the world allowed to stand in elections. In 1897, [[Catherine Helen Spence]] became the first female political candidate.&lt;ref name=&quot;aec.gov.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm |title=AEC.gov.au |publisher=AEC.gov.au |date=25 Oct. 2007 |accessdate=27 Jun. 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://foundingdocs.gov.au/item.asp?dID=8 Documenting Democracy] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/60vtMmmE7|date =2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australians had started parliamentary democracries all across the continent. But voices were getting louder for all of them to come together as one country with a national parliament.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Spain''' is a [[country]] in [[Europe]]. 
== Early History ==
People have lived on the [[Iberian Peninsula]] for about 500,000 years. [[Neanderthal]] man came about 200,000 years ago. Modern humans first came about 40,000 years. 

The [[Roman Empire]] controlled Spain for three hundred years; then people from Eastern Europe called [[Visigoths]] fought for Spain, won it from the Romans, and controlled Spain for over two hundred years.
[[File:Dama de Elche.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Lady of Elche]] made by the [[Iberian]]s]]

==9th century==
The Visigoths converted from [[Arian Christianity]] to [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]].  The land was won after a war by [[Muslims]] who were [[Arab]] and [[Berber people|Berber]].  Roman Catholics from Europe eventually decided to fight to take Spain from the Muslims. They fought wars for many hundreds of years, some of which were [[Crusades]] against other [[Christian]]s like the [[Cathar]]s. These were very cruel wars. 

In the year [[1492]], they took the last part of Spain that had belonged to the Moors. [[Boabdil]], the last [[Moor]]ish Leader of [[Granada]], gave the city to King Ferdinand of Aragon on [[2 January]] [[1492]], and Christians now ruled all of Spain.

Before this, several different kings had ruled different countries in what is now called Spain. Two of these countries, [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] and [[Aragon]], came together when the king of Aragon, [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|Ferdinand II]], married the queen of Castile, [[Isabella of Castile|Isabella]].

In the same year, 1492, they decided to send [[Christopher Columbus]] to explore the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Columbus found a land there that the people of Europe did not yet know. These were the islands of the [[Caribbean Sea]].

== Late 15th century ==
Columbus and other sailors explored more and found that there were two [[continent]]s there - [[North America]] and [[South America]]. Spain sent many soldiers and businessmen to North and South America, and they took over very large parts of those two continents. Owning this [[empire]] made Spain very rich. But when they conquered that empire, they killed millions of the [[Native American]]s who had lived there before. Spain owned this empire for more than three hundred years.

Meanwhile, at home, the Muslim manuscripts had been either burnt or spread to other countries. Jews had been expelled from Spain. The multicultural society was destroyed, and so was the learning. Among the few things kept and respected in Spain were in [[music]]: [[harmony]] and [[stringed instrument]]s, and of course the buildings, many of which became churches, by adding crosses.

== 16th and 17th centuries ==
The [[Spanish Empire]] was the strongest in the world through most of the next two centuries, thanks to [[gold]] from the [[Americas]]. This new gold made rulers and colonial governors rich. Meanwhile others' savings became worth less due to [[inflation]]. Spain became a society of very rich and very poor. Some of the poorest went to the new colonies in the [[Caribbean]], [[Central America]] and [[South America]], mostly to find gold.

[[Native American]] peoples were killed by [[disease]]s brought by the Spaniards, but most Spaniards did not know this. They found damaged and dying societies with people who had lost some of their most important leaders and thinkers. The Spaniards thought this meant they were inferior, and used this as an excuse to enslave the natives. Millions of natives died mining gold for the Spanish.

The Spanish Empire also at this time funded the [[Spanish Inquisition]] which tortured and killed anyone who disagreed with the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. The [[Reformation]] which created [[Protestant]] [[sect]]s in Europe was not allowed into Spain, it was kept out and, as with Jews or Muslims, its believers were killed.

The [[noble]]s of Spain no longer had to fight anyone since the internal feuds were over. No one could challenge their power. In many ways it was held together as a [[reign of terror]]. People who challenged them were often called [[heretic]]s, so that the Inquisition could torture them, and then nobles take the property.

For ordinary people on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean]], life got worse. A few rulers got rich. Today we would say that these people were guilty of [[war crime]]s, [[genocide]] and [[crimes against humanity]]. Many Church people who had the power to speak out at that time, did so, and they said many of the same things as we would say today. But none of this mattered much to the rulers.

The great [[satire]] [[Don Quixote]] was written about this time.

== 18th century==
In the [[18th century]], there was doubt over who should become king of Spain; this doubt led many of the kings of Europe to fight to become king of Spain. This was called the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. 

France occupied Spain for a long time. This made Spain very weak. It also made Spain lose its empire in North and South America; all of the parts of that empire became their own countries, or were taken over by other countries such as the [[United States|United States of America]].

== 20th century ==
There was not much peace in Spain during the first part of the [[20th century]]. Some [[Spaniards]] tried to set up a government chosen by the people (a [[democracy]]), and they made the [[King]] of Spain leave the country. However, in [[1936]], two different groups of [[Spaniards]] went to war over whether the government should be a democracy, or take orders from one person. In [[1939]], those who wanted democracy were defeated, and a [[dictator]] named [[Francisco Franco]] took over the government.

Franco died in [[1975]]. He had decided that [[Spain]] should have a king again, and he chose [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]], the grandson of the king who had been forced to leave the country, to be king. But the king did not rule as a dictator; instead, he chose to set up a democracy. Also since Franco's death, Spain appointed [[Adolfo Suárez]] to became Spain's first democratically elected [[Prime Minister of Spain|prime minister]]. Now Spain is a modern democratic country, and does [[business]] with many countries around the world. It is a part of the [[European Union]].

'''Height''' is the [[distance]] between the lowest end and highest end of an [[wikt:object|object]].

For example, people consider the bottom of the foot a person's lowest end, and the top of the head a person's highest end. If the distance between the bottom of a person's foot and the top of that person's head is 64 [[inch]]es, then that person's height is 64 inches.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''human body''' is the [[body]] of a [[person]]. It is the physical structure of a person. 

The body is a thing that can be hurt or killed. Its functions are stopped by [[death]].

== Study of the human body ==
[[File:Anterior view of human female and male, with labels.jpg|thumb|right|The bodies of two people of the opposite [[sex]].]]
Some people [[study]] the human body. They look at where it is different from or the same as other [[animal]]s' bodies. These animals can be alive today. Or they can be [[extinct]] animals like other [[hominid]]s. (Hominids are [[primate]]s that are close to humans. [[Neanderthal]]s and ''[[Homo erectus]]'' were hominids.) Some people study how the human body works and lives in its [[environment]]. Some people study what people think about their body. Artists study how to draw or paint the human body. 

== Fields of study ==
Many different fields of study look at the human:
* [[Biology]] is a field of [[science]]. It studies living things. It looks at how the human body works. It studies how the human body came from [[evolution]]. It studies how [[genetics]] makes the human body. 
** [[Anatomy]] studies the parts of the body and how they work together. 
** [[Ecology]] studies the environment including how humans affect it.  
* [[Anthropology]] is a field of science. It compares humans to other [[hominid]]s. It also studies all other hominid bodies. They look at how [[human]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s are the same or different.
* [[Psychology]] is a field of [[medicine]]. It looks at how people think and feel. The [[brain]] is part of the body. How we think and feel comes from the brain. So psychologists study the body. They study how the brain lets us be who we are.
* [[Religion]] also talks about the body. Some religions see the body as where the [[soul]] lives. Some see the body as like a [[church]]. This is because a church is where people [[worship]] [[God]]. These people think God should be worshiped inside people. Some religions think the body is made from [[chakras]] that connect us to the [[universe]].
* [[Medicine]] sees the body like a [[machine]]. [[Medical doctor|Doctors]] want to fix problems with the body. They study how to fix the problems, called [[disease]]s

== The human body and other animals ==
Scientists think that the human body is very much like other animals. They see that some human ''behaviors'' are like animal behaviors. (Behaviors are the way an [[organism]] acts.) They know that 98% of the [[DNA]] in humans is the same as other [[primate]]s.

=== DNA sequence differences between humans and chimpanzees ===
The animal that is alive now that is closest to humans is the [[chimpanzee]]. '''98.4%''' of the DNA is the same between humans and chimpanzees. However, this applies only to single nucleotide [[polymorphism]]s, that is, changes in ''single'' base pairs only. The full picture is rather different.

The draft sequence of the common chimpanzee [[genome]] was published in 2005. It showed that the regions which are similar enough to be aligned with one another account for 2400 million of the human genome’s 3164.7 million bases,&lt;ref name=Consortium&gt;{{cite journal | author = The Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium | year = 2005 | title = Initial sequence of the chimpanzee genome and comparison with the human genome | journal = Nature | volume = 437 | issue = 1 September 2005 | pages = 69–87 | doi = 10.1038/nature04072 | pmid = 16136131|bibcode = 2005Natur.437...69. }}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, '''75.8% of the genome'''. 

This 75.8% of the human genome is 1.23% different from the chimpanzee genome in single-nucleotide polymorphisms&lt;ref name=&quot;Consortium&quot;/&gt; (SNPs - changes of single DNA “letters” in the genome). Another type of difference, called 'indels' (insertions/deletions) account for another ~3% difference between the alignable sequences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Consortium&quot;/&gt; In addition, variation in copy number of large segments (&gt; 20 kb) of similar DNA sequence provides a further 2.7% difference between the two species.&lt;ref name=Cheng&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cheng Z. ''et al.'' | year = 2005 | title = A genome-wide comparison of recent chimpanzee and human segmental duplications | journal = Nature | volume = 437 | issue = 1 September 2005 | pages = 88–93 | doi = 10.1038/nature04000 | pmid = 16136132 | bibcode=2005Natur.437...88C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the total similarity of the genomes could be as low as about 70%.

'''Hydrogen''' is a [[chemical element]].  Its [[atomic number]] is 1, which makes it the simplest, known [[Chemical element|element]] in the entire [[universe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EIA&quot;&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/energyfacts/sources/IntermediateHydrogen.html EIA.doe.gov - What is Hydrogen?]&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogen is the true primordial substance, the first atom produced after the [[big bang]]. All chemical elements were formed from hydrogen by the processes of [[nuclear fusion]].&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Bradley W. &amp; Ostlie, Dale A. 2006. ''An introduction to modern astrophysics''. 2nd ed, Addison-Wesley, San Francisco. ISBN 0-8053-0402-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrogen glows [[purple]] when it is in [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] [[state of matter|state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.chemrec.se/Syngas_the_link_from_feedstock_to_synthetic_product.aspx |title=The magic of syngas |first= |last= |work=chemrec.se |year=2012 [last update] |accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydrogen in nature ==
In its pure form on Earth, hydrogen is usually a [[gas]]. Hydrogen is also one of the parts that make up a [[water]] molecule. Hydrogen is important because it is the [[fuel]] that powers the [[Sun]] and other stars.
Hydrogen makes up about 75% of the entire [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/ask_astro/answers/971113i.html |title=Hydrogen in the Universe |first= |last= |work=imagine.gsfc.nasa.gov |year=2012 [last update] |accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogen's symbol on the [[Periodic Table]] of Elements is H.

Pure hydrogen is normally made of two hydrogen [[atoms]] connected together. Scientists call these [[diatomic]] [[molecules]]. Hydrogen will have a [[chemical reaction]] when mixed with most other elements. It has no [[color]] or [[Odor|smell]]. 

Pure hydrogen is very uncommon in the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]]. In nature, it is usually in [[water]].  Hydrogen is also in all living things, as a part of the [[organic compounds]] that living things are made of.  In addition, hydrogen atoms can combine with [[carbon]] atoms to form [[hydrocarbons]].  [[Petroleum]] and other [[fossil fuels]] are made of these [[hydrocarbons]] and commonly used to create energy for human use.

Hydrogen has two different [[isotopes]], called [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]]. Like regular hydrogen, they both have only one [[proton]] and one [[electron]], but deuterium also has one [[neutron]] and tritium has two. These other types of hydrogen are important in [[nuclear energy]] and [[organic chemistry]] reactions. 

Some other facts about hydrogen:
* It is a gas at [[room temperature]]
* It acts like a [[metal]] when it is solid.
* It is the lightest element in the [[Universe]].
* It is the most common gas element in the Universe.&lt;ref name=&quot;EIA&quot; /&gt;
* It explodes when it touches a [[fire|flame]].

== History of Hydrogen ==
The name &quot;hydrogen&quot; comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for [[water]], 'υδορ (pronounced /HEEW-dor/).

Hydrogen was discovered in 1671 by Robert Boyle even though many people think it was discovered by Henry Cavendish in 1776.

== Uses of Hydrogen ==
=== Hydrogen as fuel (fusion) ===

[[Nuclear fusion]] is a very powerful source of [[energy]]. It relies on forcing [[atom]]s together to make [[helium]] and energy, exactly as happens in a [[star]] like the [[Sun]], or in a [[hydrogen bomb]]. This needs a large amount of energy to get started, and is not easy to do yet. A big advantage over [[nuclear fission]], which is used in [[nuclear power]] stations, is that no waste is produced, and no toxic [[fuel]] like [[uranium]] is needed.

There is more than 600 million tons of hydrogen undergoing fusion every second on the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.iter.org/sci/whatisfusion |title=What is Fusion? |first= |last= |work=iter.org |year=2012 [last update] |accessdate=7 March 2012|publisher=ITER Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/qa_sun.html|title=NASA's Cosmicopia|publisher=NASA|accessdate=28 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Burning Hydrogen ===
1. Water can be easily broken down into hydrogen and oxygen with [[electricity]], but it takes a lot of electricity to get a usable amount of hydrogen.

2. Burning hydrogen combines with oxygen molecules to make [[steam]] (pure water).

3. A fuel cell combines hydrogen with an oxygen [[molecule]] releasing an electron as electricity.

=== Hydrogen power grid ===
For these reasons, many people believe hydrogen power will eventually replace [[technology|technologies]] such as [[diesel-electric]] [[engine]]s and [[biodiesel]] fuel.

But it is not correct to see hydrogen as a fuel if it is used in a fuel cell.  It is more of a replacement for the [[power grid]].  Such a grid and [[infrastructure]] with new [[vehicle]]s might be first made in [[Iceland]], a country that has much free [[geothermal energy]] and is quite small.  Because it [[import]]s all [[fossil fuel]], it would help Iceland to completely stop using it. The huge advantage of hydrogen is that when burnt in an engine or in a fuel cell, there is no pollution. Only a small amount of water forms.

[[File:Goodyear-blimp.jpg|thumb|right|Because it is very light, helium is the gas of choice to fill [[airship]]s such as the [[Goodyear blimp]]]]
'''Helium''' is a [[chemical element]]. It has the [[chemical symbol]] '''He''', [[atomic number]] 2 and atomic weight of about 4.002602. There are 9 isotopes of helium, only two of which are stable. These are &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He and &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He. &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He is by far the most common isotope. 

Helium is called a [[noble gas]], because it does not regularly mix with other chemicals and form new [[Chemical compound|compounds]]. It has the lowest [[boiling point]] of all the elements. It is the second most common element in the [[universe]], after [[hydrogen]], and has no color or smell. However, Helium has a blue-ish, neon color when being burnt with fire. Helium does not usually [[Chemical reaction|react]] with anything else. Astronomers discovered helium in [[1868]]. They found that it was in the [[Sun]] before it was found on [[Earth]]. Because of where it was found, its name comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for Sun, ''helios''.

Helium is used to fill [[balloon]]s and [[airship]]s because it is [[density|lighter]] than [[air]], and does not burn or react, meaning it is normally safe for using it in that way. It is also used in some kinds of [[light]] bulbs. People also breathe it in to make their [[voice]]s sound higher than they normally do as a [[joke]], but this is extremely dangerous if they breathe in too much, since it can kill them because they are not breathing normal air. Breathing too much helium can also cause long-term effects to [[vocal cords]].

It can be created through the process of [[nuclear fusion]] in the [[Sunderland A.F.C.|sun]] we are currently trying to harness nuclear fusion as a form of power but this is still at an early stage because the sun can [[Quantum tunneling|quantum tunnel]] enough because of it's huge size). During this process, four Hydrogen atoms are fused together to form one Helium atom.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Beautiful healty hair.JPG|thumb|Long, brown hair]] '''Hair''' is something that grows from the [[skin]] of [[mammal]]s. Animal hair is usually called '''[[fur]]'''. [[Sheep]] and [[goat]]s have curly hair, which is usually called [[wool]]. Hair is made of [[keratin]]. Keratins are [[protein]]s.

[[Human]]s and some other [[animals]] have lost much of their hair through [[evolution]], and some other mammals, such as the [[elephant]] and the [[whale]], have almost none at all.

==Functions of hair==
[[File:Just one lion.jpg|thumb|The male lion's mane has several functions]]
Hair can have different functions:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.keratin.com/aa/aa031.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
*It can protect against losing body heat. This is thought to be the basic, original function of hair.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=why-do-humans-get-goosebu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/whats-point-pubic-hair&lt;/ref&gt;
*It protects against [[UV]] [[radiation]], which damages the skin.
*It can protect against rain or water. Air can be trapped in the fur, or oil can be secreted by the skin. Both these methods prevent the rain or water from  making the body too cold. Aquatic mammals in cold waters usually have blubber (fat) under the skin, and almost no hair.
*Defence: hair is modified in mammals like [[porcupines]], for protection.
*Hair colouring works for various functions. In some animals. for [[camouflage]]. Or, for signalling to others of the same [[species]]. Examples are: signalling to females for mating purposes and signalling to others for territory control. Signalling danger to other species ([[aposematic]] colouring) is also done by, for example, [[skunk]]s.
*Animals can change their hair so they look bigger, or more threatening. This can also be used for mating; which is the case with [[lion]]s, for example. Also, the male lions' mane also protects their neck from damage when fighting other males.

==False hair==
Some animals, for example certain [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s also have ''hairs''. However these are not hair in the biological sense, but are actually [[bristle]]s. The ''hairs'' found on certain plants are also not true hair, but [[trichome]]s.

== Human hair ==
[[Image:Mark Twain-Shirtless-ca1883.jpg|right|thumb|A man with hair on his head, face, and body.]]
In humans, hair grows mostly on the [[head]], and the amount of body hair is different from [[race (sociology)|race]] to race. [[Asian]]s and native North Americans have the least amount of body hair, while [[Caucasian]]s tend to have the most.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.belgraviacentre.com/blog/hair-types-and-race-differences/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hair color ===
Hair color is passed down by parents only. Natural hair color can be given only by [[genes]]. It is impossible to have a hair color that is not passed down [[genetics|genetically]] by both mother and father. This relies on [[dominant]] and [[recessive]] [[genes]] carried by a parent.  These genes may not be the color of their hair, however, many people carry [[genes]] that are [[recessive]] and do not show in their traits or features.

[[Dye]]ing hair is to change the color of hair. It consists of a [[chemical]] mixture which can change the color of hair by a [[chemical]] reaction. Many people dye their hair to hide gray or white hairs.  This is because most people gain white or gray hairs as they grow older.

==== Genetics and chemistry ====
Two types of [[melanin]] pigment give hair its color: ''eumelanin'' and ''pheomelanin''. Pheomelanin colors hair red. Eumelanin determines the darkness of the hair color. A low concentration of brown eumelanin results in blond hair, but more brown eumelanin will color the hair brown. High amounts of black eumelanin result in black hair, while low concentrations give gray hair. All humans have some pheomelanin in their hair.

The genetics of hair colors are not yet firmly established. According to one theory, at least two gene pairs control human hair color.

One phenotype (brown/blond) has a [[dominant]] brown [[allele]] and a [[recessive]] [[blond]] allele. A person with a brown allele will have brown hair; a person with no brown alleles will be blond. This explains why two brown-haired parents can produce a blond-haired child.

The other gene pair is a non-red/red pair, where the not-red allele  is dominant and the allele for red hair is recessive. A person with two copies of the red-haired allele will have red hair, but it will be either auburn or bright reddish orange depending on whether the first gene pair gives brown or blond hair, respectively.

The two-gene model does not account for all possible shades of brown, blond, or red (for example, platinum blond versus dark blonde/light brown), nor does it explain why hair color sometimes darkens as a person ages. Several other gene pairs control the light versus dark hair color in a cumulative effect ([[quantitative genetics]]).

=== Hair texture ===
Hair texture is also inherited genetically. The thickness of hair, its color and its tendency to curl are all inherited. There are also genetic differences between men and women. Body hair is limited in women, and thicker in men.

=== Hair loss ===
[[File:Ad van Liempt.jpg|thumb|Typical male pattern baldness]] People have about 100,000 hairs on their head.  About 100 fall out each day, but they usually grow back. Some men are bald but girls and women may become bald if they lose their hair from a disease called [[Alopecia]].

Men often lose some of their hair as they grow older. This is known as ''baldness''. Doctors call it &quot;[[male pattern baldness]]&quot; because hairs often fall out in similar places. It often begins by hair falling out first from the front of the head, and then from the top of the head. After a while, all that may be left is a some hair running above the ears and around the lower back of the head. Even though it is unusual for women to go bald, many women suffer from thinning hair over the top of their head as they grow old.

People have tried to find cures for hair loss for thousands of years. In an effort to get their hair back, men have tried &quot;cures&quot; like applying strange lotions or even having their heads packed in [[chicken]] [[manure]].&lt;ref&gt;http://hisrad.org/what-are-the-causes-of-hair-loss-in-women/&lt;/ref&gt;{{fact|date=April 2009}} Many unproven &quot;cures&quot; are still marketed today. It is only in the last decade or so that [[treatment]]s have been developed which do sometimes work. Some doctors do hair [[transplant]]s, where they take tiny plugs of hair from areas like the back of the neck and plant them in the bald spots on the head. Some [[drug]]s have been tested and approved for sale as hair loss treatments. They encourage hair regrowth and thickening, but work better if applied before hair loss turns to baldness.

=== History and culture ===
[[File:Orit's Cornrows work.jpg|thumb|A braided hairstyle]] [[File:Visualfan.jpg|thumb|A bold hair color and style]] People have been interested in hair on their heads for hundreds of thousands of years. For both men and women, styling and coloring hair have been ways to look good, and get attention. Sometimes society makes rules about hair, for example by not allowing people to cut their hair or [[beard]]s, like in [[Sikhism]] (it is also good to do this in Islam, but not a requirement).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.islamic-laws.com/beard.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{about|the island of Ireland}}

[[File:LocationIslandIreland.png|thumb|250px|Ireland on a map of [[Europe]]]]
[[File:Topography Ireland.jpg|thumb|250px|Topographical map of Ireland]]
'''Ireland''' is an [[island]] in [[Europe]]. To the west of Ireland is the [[Atlantic Ocean]]; to the east of Ireland, across the [[Irish Sea]], is the island of [[Great Britain]].

The island of Ireland is about 486 [[Kilometer|km]] (302 [[miles]]) long and about 288&amp;nbsp;km (179 miles) wide. About 6.4 million people live on the island {{ndash}} 4.6 million in the [[Republic of Ireland]] and 1.8 million in [[Northern Ireland]].

The [[River Shannon]], which runs from north to south, is the longest river on the island. Ireland has many [[lake]]s. Lough Neagh, in Northern Ireland, is the largest lake in Ireland. Ireland is known for its beautiful landscapes, [[music]], history, and [[mythology]].

Today, the island of Ireland is split between two countries:

* The [[Republic of Ireland]] is five sixths (83%) of the island. Its capital city is [[Dublin]]. The official languages are [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[English language|English]]. Most people in the country can speak a little Irish, but only a small number of the population are fluent or native speakers. Almost everyone learns Irish at school, but most people outside the [[Gaeltacht]] speak [[English language|English]] in their day-to-day lives.
* [[Northern Ireland]] is the remaining one sixth (17%) of the island and is part of the [[United Kingdom]]. The capital of Northern Ireland is [[Belfast]].

Many people live in the eastern coasts of both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Dublin has a population of more than one million, and the Greater Belfast region has a population of nearly half a million.

==Provinces and Counties==
Ireland is traditionally divided into four provinces and thirty-two counties. Twenty-six counties are in the Republic and six in Northern Ireland. Three of the provinces are entirely within the Republic (Connacht, Leinster and Munster), and one province (Ulster) has some counties in both the Republic and in Northern Ireland.
* [[Connacht]] - Galway, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo
* [[Leinster]] - Carlow, Dublin, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Longford, Louth, Meath, Offaly, Westmeath, Wexford, Wicklow
* [[Munster]] - Clare, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Tipperary, Waterford
* [[Ulster]] - Cavan, Donegal, Monaghan (Republic of Ireland); Antrim, Armagh, Derry/Londonderry, Down, Fermanagh, Tyrone (Northern Ireland)

==Main Cities==
[[Dublin]] is the largest city in the country and capital of the Republic of Ireland. Dublin was established as a Viking settlement in the 9th century. Population 525,383 (Dublin City), 1,270,603 (Co. Dublin)

The city of [[Belfast]] is the capital of Northern Ireland. It has 483,000 in the Greater Belfast urban area, and 267,000 in the city itself. Shipbuilding used to be a major industry here; the [[RMS Titanic|Titanic]] was built in Belfast at the Harland and Wolff shipyard.

[[Armagh]], in Northern Ireland, is often called the 'Ecclesiastic Capital of Ireland' as it is the seat of both the [[Catholic Church]] and the (Protestant) [[Church of Ireland]]. Population 14,590

[[Cork (city)|Cork]] is the largest city in Munster. Corconians often jokingly refer to it as 'the Real Capital'. Population 119,230.

[[Derry]] (also known as Londonderry), is the second largest city in Northern Ireland. Derry is notable for the Medieval city walls which still stand. Because the walls have never been breached the city is nicknamed &quot;The Maiden City&quot;. In 2013 Derry/Londonderry is the UK Capital of Culture, therefore many cultural events will take place in the city throughout the year. Population 83,652

==History==
12,000 years ago, most of Ireland was covered with ice. The [[Ice Age]] then ended and Ireland became covered with trees. The first people came to Ireland about 9,000 years ago, in the Middle [[Stone Age]] (Mesolithic period). They were nomadic. Once food ran out in the place they lived, they would move to another place. Evidence of these people was found in Mount Sandel, Co. Derry. 

About 4000BC, in the New Stone Age (Neolithic period), the first farmers arrived in Ireland. These people cleared openings in the forest and built permanent settlements with houses and farmland. When people in this age died, they were buried in tombs called megaliths. Many megaliths are left standing today, such as portal dolmens and passage tombs. The most famous megalith is Newgrange passage tomb in co. Meath. 

New settlers came around 2000BC, marking the start of the [[Bronze Age]]. Copper was mined mainly in Mount Gabriel, co. Cork, and tin was imported from Cornwall. These people used bronze to make weapons, such as swords. They also used it to make early forms of jewellery, such as sun discs and torcs. These settlers buried the dead in cost graves or wedge tombs, and burial places have been found with stone circles. 

It is unknown when the [[Celts]] came to Ireland, but it is likely they brought the use of iron with them. The use of iron marks the start of the [[Iron Age]]. It is known that by about 300BC, the use of iron and Celtic culture was widespread in Ireland. The celts lived in ring forts, hill forts, promontory forts and crannógs. It is thought that only the richer families and settlements lived in crannógs. These were man-made islands in the middle of lakes with houses on them. 

Celtic Ireland was split into around 150 kingdoms called tuath. The king was elected from the royal family. Below the king were the Nobles, and the Aos Dána, who were people with special skills, such as poets, Druids (priests), judges and craftsmen. 

By the early 6th century, Ireland was mostly Christian through the work of [[St. Patrick]] and other missionaries. [[Druids]] were replaced by priests and monks. Monasteries soon were built such as Glendalough in co. Wicklow. Glendalough and other monasteries built round towers for safety when [[Vikings]] attacked. Small monasteries were also built in remote places, the most famous being Skellig Michael, off the coast of co. Kerry. 

At this time many manuscripts (hand-written books) were created by the monasteries such as the Cathach, the Book of Durrow, and the Book of Kells. Monks also produced fine silver chalices, croziers and brooches, and carved high crosses. 

In 1169, [[Anglo-Norman]] lords invaded Ireland, led by [[Strongbow]], who landed at Passage, co. Waterford. The Anglo-Normans conquered many parts of Ireland the following 60 years, Introducing their way of life. The feudal system was soon introduced in Ireland as means of organising land. Castles were built to defend the land like Trim Castle, co. Meath. During the Middle Ages, Ireland's first proper towns were built. 

From 1801 until 1922 all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. In 1921 Northern Ireland was created and 'partitioned' from the south. Northern Ireland has stayed within the United Kingdom since then. The full name of the UK is 'The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'.

In 1922 the south became the [[Irish Free State]]. In 1937 the Irish Free State adopted a new constitution which named the state '[[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]', and in 1948 this state passed the Republic of Ireland Act which declared it to be a [[republic]].

==Migration==
Many Irish people have left Ireland and moved to the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], and [[South America]]. The [[Irish Potato Famine|Great Famine]] in the 1840's forced many to leave; it is estimated almost a million people died of starvation, and a million more emigrated. From a maximum of over 8 million in 1841, the total Irish population dropped to just over 4 million in the 1940s. Since then, the population has grown to over 6 million. This has been helped by the economic growth of the &quot;Celtic Tiger&quot; and since 2004 immigration from countries in [[Eastern Europe]] such as [[Poland]].

Today almost 80 million people around the world are descended from Irish immigrants.

The '''Internet''' is a large group of [[computers]] [[computer network|that are connected to each other]].  The Internet is used to send information quickly between computers around the world.  It has millions of smaller [[domestic]], [[academic]], [[business]], and [[government]] networks and websites, which together carry many different kinds of [[information]] (facts and details) and services. So in other words, the Internet is a network of networks. 

== History ==
The Internet was created in the [[United States]] by the &quot;[[United States Department of Defense]] Advanced Research Projects Agency&quot; (ARPA). It was first connected in October, 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
 |url= http://www.walthowe.com/navnet/history.html
 |title=A Brief History of the Internet
 |work=walthowe.com
 |accessdate=13 July 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Wide Web]] was created
at [[CERN]] in [[Switzerland]] in 1989 by a [[United Kingdom|British]] (UK) [[man]] named [[Tim Berners-Lee]].

Today, people can pay [[money]] to access the Internet from [[Internet service provider|Internet Service Providers]]. Some services on the Internet cost nothing to use. Sometimes the people who offer these free services use [[advertising]] to make money from them.
The alternative (other) name, &quot;Net&quot; came from &quot;Inter(net)&quot;.

== Services on the Internet ==
The Internet is used for many things, such as [[electronic mail]], [[online chat]], [[computer file|file]] transfer, and the interlinked [[web page]]s and other documents of the [[World Wide Web]].

The most used service on the Internet is the World Wide Web (which is also called the &quot;Web&quot;). The Web contains [[website]]s, [[blog]]s, and also [[wiki]]s like [[Wikipedia]]. [[Webpage]]s on the internet can be seen and read by anyone (unless the page needs a [[password]], or it is blocked).

The second major use of the Internet is to send and receive e-mail. E-mail is private and goes from one [[:wikt:user|user]] to another. [[Instant messaging]] (such as [[AIM]] or [[ICQ]]) is similar to email, but allows two or more people to chat to each other much faster.

Some governments think the Internet is a bad thing, and block all or part of it.  For example, the Chinese government thinks that Wikipedia is bad. Many times no one in [[China]] can read it or add to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=posted by abennett |url=http://www.itworld.com/040614wikipedia |title=Chinese censors block access to Wikipedia |publisher=ITworld |date=2004-06-14 |accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[parent]]s block parts of the Internet they think are bad for [[child]]ren to see. Well-known examples of the whole Internet being blocked are in [[North Korea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/IMG/pdf/Internet_enemies_2009_2_.pdf |title=Rapport @ 09 GB |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Myanmar.

==  Dangers on the Internet==
The Internet can also be a dangerous place. Information that people put on the Internet is not always checked, and some may not be true. Some may even be harmful. Also, if someone sends information through the internet, sometimes other people can read it even when they are not supposed to. For example, [[Facebook]] has had some problems with [[wikt:privacy|privacy]] settings. A person can post information on a website, but this is often a bad idea unless the person is very sure of what they are doing. A good way to check for a secure website is to make sure the [[URL]] starts with &lt;nowiki&gt;https://&lt;/nowiki&gt; instead of &lt;nowiki&gt;http://&lt;/nowiki&gt;, this means it is a secure site. (This only stops other people from reading what a user types. It does not mean the website is safe)
* Some websites may trick people into [[download]]ing [[computer virus|viruses]] that can harm a computer or [[spyware]] that [[spy|spies]] on its users (looks at what they are doing and tells someone else).  E-mails can also have harmful files with them as &quot;attachments&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiredsafety.org/internet101/viruses.html |title=Internet Safety: Internet 101 - Viruses, worms and Trojans |publisher=Wiredsafety.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[IRC|Internet chatrooms]], people might be preying on others or trying to [[stalking|stalk]] or [[abuse]] them.
* The Internet contains content that many people find offensive such as [[pornography]], as well as content intended to be offensive.

'''Italy''' is a [[country]] in [[Southern Europe]] and a member of the [[European Union]]. Its official name is '''Repubblica Italiana'''. Italy is a [[democratic]] [[republic]] and is a [[wikt:found|founding]] member of the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=EU&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://europa.eu/abc/european_countries/eu_members/italy/index_en.htm|title=European Countries|publisher=European Union|accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italy is also a member of the [[G8]], as it has the 8th largest [[Gross Domestic Product]] in the world.  Its President is [[Sergio Mattarella]] and its Prime Minister is [[Matteo Renzi]].  Before 1861, it was made up of smaller kingdoms and city-states.

==Geography==
{{further|Italian Peninsula}}
[[File:Satellite image of Italy in March 2003.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Satellite (artificial)|Satellite]] image of Italy]]
Italy is a [[peninsula]], meaning it is encompassed by the sea on all of its sides apart from one side of the country (its north side). Northern Italy is separated from [[France]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Austria]] by the [[Alps]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blurtit.com/q714533.html|title=Alps are the border between Italy and other countries}}&lt;/ref&gt; a chain of mountains. [[Mont Blanc]] (''Monte Bianco'' in Italian or white mountain in English), the highest mountain in western [[Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1940971.stm| publisher = BBC News | accessdate = 23 July 2009 | date = 20 April 2002 |title = Four missing in Alps avalanche}}&lt;/ref&gt; belongs to this chain. The second important chain of mountains in Italy is the [[Apennines]] (''Appennini'' in Italian), which are in central and southern Italy.

The [[Capital (city)|capital]] of Italy is [[Rome]]. Other cities in Italy are [[Milan]], [[Turin]], [[Florence]], [[Genoa]], [[Naples]], [[Palermo]] and [[Venice]]. The country has a number of islands, the biggest of which are [[Sicily]] and [[Sardinia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldislandinfo.com/LARGESTV1.html|title=Biggest Islands in the World}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Encarta&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555207/italy.html|title=Italy: Encarta|publisher=MSN|accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be reached by ship or [[aircraft]].&lt;ref name=Encarta /&gt;

The [[Po River]] is the longest river in Italy. It flows through 5 cities: Torino, Piacenza, Cremona Ferrara and Rovigo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0205/feature6/index.html |title=National Geographic |accessdate=2009-07-20 |last=Zwingle |first=Eria |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=National Geographic |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tiber River]] runs through the city of [[Rome]].

Northern Italy has some of the biggest lakes in the country, such as [[Lake Garda]], [[Lake Como]], [[Lake Maggiore]] and [[Lake Iseo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2005/mar/19/italy.guardiansaturdaytravelsection | work = The Guardian | date = 19 March 2005 | accessdate = 23 July 2009| title = The lake show |first = Philip | last=Watson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because it is surrounded by the sea, Italy has many [[kilometer]]s of [[coast]], which brings [[tourism|tourists]] from all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3896487.stm | publisher = BBC News | accessdate = 23 July 2009 | date = 15 July 2004 | title = Tourism damaging Med's wetlands}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tourists also come to see Italy's many [[history|historical]] places.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2496923.stm | publisher = BBC News | title = Alarm sounded over Italy's treasures | date = 20 November 2002 | accessdate = 23 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two very small countries are located within Italy. They are [[San Marino]], which is surrounded by part of Northern Italy, and the [[Vatican City]], which is inside Rome.  

== People and culture ==
[[File:Leonardo self.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leonardo Da Vinci]]]]
People from Italy are called Italians. Nearly all the Italians are [[Christian]], and most of these are [[Roman Catholic]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/it.html|title=Italy|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=2009-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[population]] of Italy is a little over 60 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flagcounter.com/factbook/it |title=Flag Counter: Italy |accessdate=2009-07-11 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; About 2.7 million of them live in [[Rome]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.routard.com/guide/rome/1823/carte_d_identite.htm|title=Rome's Population}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1.3 million in [[Milan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aboutmilan.com/the-city-of-milan.html|title=Milan's Population}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official language of Italy is [[Italian language|Italian]] and in some small areas German, Slovenian or French. People also speak languages such as Sicilian and Sardinian, which are very [[wikt:similar|similar]] to Italian, but are different dialects of Italian.

There are many different dialects spoken in Italy. They vary between regions and, in some cases, also between provinces.

The people of Italy are partly [[descendant]] from the [[ancient Rome|ancient Romans]].

Italy is home to more [[World Heritage Site]]s than any other nation in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/|title=List of UNESCO World Heritage Sites|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sites are culturally important and valued according to [[UNESCO]]. About 60% of the works of [[art]] of the world are in Italy. Italy is also a big [[wine]] producer. In 2005 it made over 5 million tonnes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reference.com/browse/wiki/Wine_production_by_country|title=Countries by wine Production}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==

Italy has a modern social welfare system. The labor market enjoys relative strength, with many foreigners, especially from [[Romania]], working in Italy where the wages are much higher. But it could have been much more workers on the labor market because men and women already retired in the age of 57 and the unemployment rate is relatively high at 8.2 percent.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pensionfundsonline.co.uk/113/country-profiles/italy/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2011/02/weodata/weorept.aspx?sy=2009&amp;ey=2016&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=136&amp;s=LUR&amp;grp=0&amp;a=&amp;pr.x=16&amp;pr.y=16&lt;/ref&gt; Italy's modern society has been built up through loans and now the country has a catastrophic high debt of €1.9trn or 120 percent of the country's total GDP. And the government can't pay back the loans during the time period the EU wish.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2058965/Italy-debt-crisis-Rome-burns-Euroland-bridges.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics ==
[[File:Obelisk of montecitorio arp.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]]]]

The [[Head of state|Head of State]] is [[Sergio Mattarella]], whose task began in February 2015. Mattarella is currently the President of the Italian Republic. The first president was [[Enrico De Nicola]].

The [[Head of government|Head of Government]] is [[Matteo Renzi]], who became [[Prime Minister]] on [[February 22]], [[2014]], succeeding [[Enrico Letta]]. Renzi was previously the [[Mayor]] of [[Florence]] and is Italy's youngest-ever [[Prime Minister]], at age 39 when taking office.

Italy was one of the first members of the [[European Union]] and in 2002, along with 11 other European countries, it changed to using the [[euro]] as its official [[currency]]. Before this, the [[Italian lira]] had been used since 1861.

Anyone who wants to be President of Italy must have Italian citizenship, be at least 50 years old, and must be able to hold political and [[civil rights]].

== History ==
[[File:Colosseum in Rome, Italy - April 2007.jpg|thumb|The [[Colosseum]] in Rome is very old.]]
[[File:Leaning tower of pisa 2.jpg|thumb|[[Leaning Tower of Pisa]]]]
Before 1861, Italy was not a [[state]]. The area was made of a group of independent states, ruled by other countries (such as Austria, France, and Spain). In the 1850s the [[Earl]] of [[Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour|Camillo Cavour]] was the Head of Government of the &quot;State of Sardinia&quot;. He talked to the Austrians in Lombardy and Veneto and said they should create a Northern Italian state. This happened, but other Central and Southern Italian states also joined Piedmont to create a bigger state.

In 1860, [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] took control of Sicily, creating the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861.&lt;ref name=Encarta /&gt; [[Vittorio Emanuele II]] was made the King. But, in 1861, Latium and Veneto were still not part of Italy, because they were ruled by the [[Pope]] and Austrian Empire.

Veneto was made part of Italy in 1866 after a war with Austria, and Italian soldiers won Latium in 1870. That was when they took away the Pope's power. The Pope, who was angry, said that he was a prisoner to keep [[Catholicism|Catholic]] people from being active in politics. That year, Italy finally came back together.

Italy participated in [[World War I]] as an [[ally]] of [[Great Britain]], [[France]], and Russia against the [[Central Powers]]. Almost all of Italy's fighting was on the Eastern [[border]], near Austria. After the &quot;[[Caporetto]] defeat&quot;, Italy thought they would lose the war. But, in 1918, the Central Powers [[wikt:surrender|surrender]]ed, and Italy gained the Trentino-South Tyrol, which once was owned by Austria.

In 1922, a new Italian government started, and it was ruled by [[Benito Mussolini]], the leader of [[Fascism]] in Italy. He became [[Head of Government]] and [[dictator]], calling himself &quot;duce&quot; - which means &quot;[[leader]]&quot; in [[Italian language|Italian]]. He became friends with German dictator Hitler, and Mussolini followed him into [[World War II]]. Italy entered the war in 1940 as an ally of [[Germany]] and [[Japan]] against France, Great Britain, and [[Russia]]. During the war, Italy controlled most of the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

On [[July 25]], 1943, Mussolini was removed by the Great Council of Fascism, and, on [[September 8]], 1943, [[Badoglio]] said that the war as an ally of Germany was ended. Italy started fighting as an ally of France and the UK, but Italian soldiers did not know who to shoot. In Northern Italy, a [[wikt:movement|movement]] called [[Italian resistance movement|Resistenza]] started to fight against the German [[invasion|invaders]].

Mussolini tried to make another Northern Italian [[Fascism|fascist]] state, the [[Republic of Salò]], but it failed. On [[April 25]], 1945, Italy became free. The state became a republic on [[June 2]], 1946, and, for the first time, women were able to vote. Italian people ended the Savoia [[dynasty]] and adopted a republic government.

In February 1947, Italy signed a peace treaty with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] losing all the colonies and some territorial areas ([[Istria]] and parts of [[Dalmatia]]).

Since then Italy has joined [[NATO]] and the European Community (as a founding member), becoming one of the seven biggest industrial economies in the world.

The [[Rail transport|railway]] [[wikt:network#Noun|network]] in Italy totals 16,627 kilometres (10,331&amp;nbsp;mi), the 17th longest in the world. High speed trains include [[ElettroTreno|ETR]]-class trains which travel at 300&amp;nbsp;km/h (190&amp;nbsp;[[mph]]).

An '''idiom''' is a [[word]] or [[phrase]] which means something different from its literal meaning. Idioms are common phrases or terms whose meaning is not real, but can be understood by their popular use.

Because idioms can mean something different from what the words mean it is difficult for someone not very good at speaking the language to use them properly. Some idioms are only used by some groups of people or at certain times. The idiom ''shape up or ship out'', which is like saying ''improve your behavior or leave if you don't'',  might be said by an employer or supervisor to an employee, but not to other people.

Idioms are not the same thing as [[slang]]. Idioms are made of normal words that have a special meaning known by almost everyone. Slang is usually special words that are known only by a particular group.

To learn a language a person needs to learn the words in that language, and how and when to use them. But people also need to learn idioms separately because certain words together or at certain times can have different meanings. In order to understand an idiom, one sometimes needs to know the culture the idiom comes from.

To know the history of an idiom can be useful and interesting, but is not necessary to be able to use the idiom properly. For example most native British English speakers know that &quot;No room to swing a cat&quot; means &quot;there was not a lot of space&quot; and can use the idiom properly, but few know it is because 200 years ago sailors were punished by being whipped with a whip called a &quot;cat o'nine tails&quot;.{{cn|date=February 2012}} A big space was cleared on the ship so that the person doing the whipping had a lot of room to ''swing the cat''.

A better understanding of an idiom is that it is a phrase whose meaning cannot be understood from the dictionary definitions of each word taken separately. 

==Some common idioms==
* ''Break a leg''
: A way to wish someone good luck.
* ''To live it up''
: To enjoy life, to live widely
* ''To kick the [[bucket]]''
: To die.
* ''Shape up or [[ship]] out''
: Used to tell someone that they should leave if they don't improve their [[behavior]] or performance
* ''To shed [[crocodile]] tears''
: To cry about something but without actually caring.
* ''Wild [[goose]] chase''
: A useless journey or pursuit.
* ''There's no room to swing a cat''
: There is not a lot of space.
* ''To pay through the nose''
: To pay a lot of money, more than is normal.
* ''To bark up the wrong tree''
: To choose the wrong course of action.
* ''To spill the beans''
: To tell a secret.
* ''It's raining cats and dogs''
: It's raining heavily.
* ''To get into hot water''
: To get into trouble.
* ''To be [[chicken]]-hearted''
: To be scared.
* ''Top dog''
: Leader.
* ''To smell a rat''
: To think that something is wrong.
* ''To chicken out''
: Not doing an activity because of [[fear]].
* ''To give up''
: To quit.
* ''To give up on''
: To stop believing in something or someone.
* ''I could eat a horse''
: To be very hungry.
* ''To be on top of the world''
:To be really happy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''International English Language Testing System''' (IELTS) tests how good you are at the [[English language]]. People who take the test take the Academic Module or the General Training Module. The academic one is for people who want to go to university. The general one is for people who want to do other training or want to get work experience. People who want to emigrate to a country that uses English also take the general one.

Most universities in Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the United States accept the IELTS. Many professional companies do as well.

'''Ink''' is a [[liquid]] that is used to [[write]], [[draw]], print, or make marks. The word ink is from [[Latin language|Latin]] and means &quot;colored water&quot;. Ink is used in [[pen]]s, in some computer printers, and in [[printing press]]es. In some countries, people write by using ink and [[brush]]es. People usually write or print using black ink, but ink can be any [[color]]. The first ink was used in [[Egypt]] about 2600 BC.

A disadvantage of many kinds of ink is that they may smudge when wet, spoiling the picture or writing. 

The first inks were carbon inks, made from soot, which is 80% [[carbon]], water and [[gum arabic]]. Red ink would need [[iron oxide]] (such as [[haematite]]) from ground rocks instead of soot. Later, in Europe, people used iron gall ink. This is the kind of ink [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] used. Now ink colours are produced by [[dye]]s.

Ink in a ball point pen is held in a thin long [[cylinder]] (tube) inside the pen. The ink does not fall out of the cylinder as it sticks to the sides of the tube.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''inch''' is a unit of [[length]] in the [[Imperial unit|Imperial system]] and the [[United States customary units|United States customary system]]. The [[abbreviation]] for inches is '''in''' or '''&quot;'''. There are 12&amp;nbsp;inches in a [[Foot (unit of length)|foot]]. One inch is equal to 2.54&amp;nbsp;[[centimetre]]s.

The word &quot;inch&quot; came from [[Middle English]] ''unche'', which came from [[Old English]] ''ynce'', from [[Latin]] ''uncia'' meaning &quot;a twelfth part&quot;.

== History ==

The inch was originally defined as 3 [[Barleycorn (unit)|barleycorns]]. The inch was finally standardised in the International Yard and Pound Treaty in 1959 between the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]]. The international yard was made equal to 0.9144 [[metre]]s. From this, subdivisions and multiples of the yard were specifically defined.

== Usage ==

In [[Britain]] and the [[United States]], people use inches more than they use [[millimetre]]s or [[centimetre]]s. In the rest of the world, [[International System of Units|international units]] are almost always used. The inch is not used by scientists.

In the United Kingdom, [[Traffic sign|road signs]] that show how high a vehicle can be in order to pass through a [[tunnel]] are required to be in feet and inches. [[Theme park]]s and [[Drive-through|drive thru]] signs usually show it in metres. People regularly measure their [[height]] in feet and inches. Official medical records, however, are required to record people's height in [[Metric system|metric]] measurements only.

In Canada, a mix of centimetres and inches are used in height. Older generations, especially, use Imperial units. A lot of exposure to [[Americanisation|Americanized]] phrases leads to younger generations often having a good understanding of both the Imperial and metric systems.

In the United States, height is always in feet and inches. Science is the only field to use metric measurements.

Other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, including [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and [[Jamaica]] use inches to varying degrees. From every day use to exclusively the older community.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''pint''' (abbreviated '''pt.''') is a unit of volume in [[Imperial units|Imperial]] and [[U.S. customary units|U.S. units]]. There are several types of pints used in different countries. An Imperial pint and U.S. pint both equal {{frac|1|2|}} of a quart and {{frac|1|8|}} of a gallon.

An Imperial fluid ounce is approx. 4% smaller than a U.S. fluid ounce although an Imperial pint has 4 more fluid ounces than a U.S. pint making 1 Imperial Pint roughly 20% larger than a U.S. pint in total.

==Imperial Pint==
The Imperial pint is the pint used in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Burma]]. The unit may appear in other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries that converted to the [[Metric System]]. Confusion in Canada often arises as liquids are often sold in U.S. pints although the official and only pint that is legal in Canada is the Imperial pint. The Imperial system has no dry pint and volume in dry units e.g. apples are the same as liquid pints. 1 Imperial pint of water at 62 °F (16.7 °C) weighs 1{{frac|1|4|}} lbs. (566.99 g)

|}

==U.S. Wet Pint==
The U.S. wet pint or more commonly 'pint' is the unit used to measure volume in the [[United States of America|United States]]. It is more common than the dry pint which is used for non-liquid volume measurements. 1 U.S. pint of water at 62 °F (16.7 °C) weighs 1.04375 pounds lbs. (473.437g)
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

|}

==U.S. Dry Pint==
The U.S. dry pint is the unit used for measuring the volume of solid objects instead of by mass or quantity. E.g. a pint of strawberries is a container with a volume of 1 dry pint full of strawberries. 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Units !! Dry Pints !! Dry Quarts !! Dry Gallons !! Pecks !! Bushels !! Dry Hogshead !! U.S Wet Pints !! Imp. Pints !! Millilitres
|-
| Pint || 1 || {{frac|1|2|}} || {{frac|1|8|}} || {{frac|1|16|}} || {{frac|1|64|}} || {{frac|1|512|}} || ≈1.16 || ≈ 0.97 || 550.6104713575 
|}

==Usage==
* The Wet and Dry U.S pints are still commonly used in the United States.
*In Canada it is commonly used for alchohol although a pint can vary from 12 fl oz to 20 fl oz and is sometimes incorrectly given in U.S. fl oz
*In the United Kingdom and Ireland: milk, alchohol and cooking ingredients/tools are often given in pints, although due to E.U regulations most liquids are now given in [[Metric system|metric units]] with occasional dual units.

'''ISO 19011''' is the new [[global]] [[accounting]] [[standard]], replacing accounting standards that were part of [[ISO 14001]] and [[ISO 9001]].  It is the most likely basis for [[accounting reform]] which could put an end to [[accounting scandal]]s.

{{main|History of India}}
Two of the main Classical languages of the world— [[Sanskrit]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]], were born in India. Both of these languages are more than 3000 years old. The country founded a [[religion]] called [[Hinduism]], which most Indians still follow. Later, a king called [[Ashoka]] built an empire called the Maurya dynasty in 300 BC. It made most of [[South Asia]] into one whole country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Many [[dynasty|dynasties]] ruled India around the year 1000. Some of these were the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]], [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]], and the [[Maratha Empire|Maratha]] empires. In the 1600s, European countries invaded India, and the British controlled most of India by 1856.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After 1947, India has had a socialist planned economy. It is one founding member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and the [[United Nations]]. It has fought many [[war]]s since independence from [[Britain]], including in 1947-48, 1965, 1971, and 1999 with [[Pakistan]] and in 1962 with [[People's Republic of China|China]]. It also fought a war to capture [[Goa]], a [[Portugal|Portuguese]]-built [[harbour|port]] and city which was not a part of India until 1961. The Portuguese refused to give it to the country, and so India had to use force and the Portuguese were defeated.

&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;Its government is divided into three parts: the Legislative (the one that makes the laws, the Parliament), the Executive (the government), and the Judiciary (the one that makes sure that the laws are obeyed, the supreme court).

The Legislative branch is made up of the [[Parliament]] of India, which is in [[New Delhi]], the capital of India. The Parliament of India is divided into two groups: the upper house, Rajya Sabha (Council of States); and the lower house, Lok Sabha (House of People). The Rajya Sabha has 250 members,&lt;ref name=&quot;Parliament&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The Executive branch is made up of the [[President]], [[Vice President]], [[Prime Minister]], and the Council of Ministers. The President of India is elected for five years. The President can choose the Prime Minister, who has most of the power. The Council of Ministers, such as the Minister of Defence, help the Prime Minister. Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister of India on May 16, 2014. He is the 19th Prime Minister of India.

The Judicial branch is made up of the [[court]]s of India, including the Supreme Court. The Chief Justice of India is the head of the Supreme Court. Supreme Court members have the power to stop a law being passed by Parliament if they think that the law is illegal and contradicts (opposes) the [[Constitution]] of India.&lt;ref name=&quot;manorama&quot;&gt;{{cite book |first=K.M. |last=Matthew |title=Manorama Yearbook 2003 |publisher=Malayala Manorama |year=2008 |isbn= 81-89004-07-7 |pages=pg 524}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, there are also 21 High Courts.

== Geography and climate ==
[[File:Indiarivers.png|thumb|Rivers of India]]

India is the seventh largest country in the world. It is the main part of the [[Indian subcontinent]].  The countries next to India are [[Pakistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Myanmar]], [[China]], [[Bhutan]], and [[Nepal]].  It is also near [[Sri Lanka]], an [[island]] country.

India is a [[peninsula]], which means that it is surrounded on three sides by water.One of the seven wonders of the world is located in Agra the Taj Mahal . In the west is the [[Arabian Sea]], in the south is the [[Indian Ocean]], and in the east is the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The northern part of India has many mountains. The most famous mountain range in India is the [[Himalayas]], which have some of the tallest [[mountain]]s in the world. There are many rivers in India. The main rivers are the [[Ganges]], the [[Brahmaputra]], the [[Yamuna]], the Godavari, the Kaveri, the Narmada, and the Krishna.

India has different climates.&lt;ref name=&quot;CONCISE ENCYCLOPEDIA 4&quot;&gt;{{cite book
|title = Concise Encyclopedia
|publisher = Dorling Kindersly Limited
|year = 1997
|pages = p. 333
|isbn = 0-7513-5911-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the South, the climate is mainly tropical, which means it can get very hot in summer and cool in winter.&lt;ref name=&quot;CONCISE ENCYCLOPEDIA 4&quot;/&gt; The northern part, though, has a cooler climate, called sub-tropical, and even alpine in mountainous regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;CONCISE ENCYCLOPEDIA 4&quot;/&gt; The [[Himalayas]], in the alpine climate region, can get extremely cold. There is very heavy [[rainfall]] along the west coast and in the Eastern Himalayan foothills. The west, though, is drier. Because of some of the [[desert]]s of India, all of India gets rain for four months of the year. That time is called the monsoon. That is because the deserts attract water-filled winds from the Indian Ocean, which give rain when they come into India. When the monsoon rains come late or not so heavily, [[drought]]s (when the land dries out because there is less rain) are possible.

== Indian states ==
For [[administration]] purposes, India has been divided into smaller pieces. Most of these pieces are called [[state]]s, some are called [[Union territory|union territories]]. States and union territories are different in the way they are represented. Most union territories are ruled by administrators sent by the central government. All the states, and the territories of Dehli, and Puducherry [[election|elect]] their local government themselves. In total, there are twenty-nine states, and seven union territories.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOC PROFILE&quot;/&gt;

== Trouble with the borders ==
There are [[wikt:dispute|disputes]] about certain parts of the Indian borders. Countries do not agree on where the borders are. [[Pakistan]] and [[China]] do not recognise the disputed territory of [[Occupied Kashmir]]. The Indian government calls it ''Jammu and Kashmir'' and believes it is an Indian state. Similarly, the Republic of India does not recognise the Pakistani and Chinese parts of Kashmir.

In 1914, [[British India]] and [[Tibet]] agreed on the [[McMahon Line]], as part of the [[Simla Accord (1914)|Simla Accord]]. Indians and Tibetans see this line as the official border. China does not agree, and both mainland China and [[Taiwan]] do not recognize that  Arunachal Pradesh belongs to India. According to them, it is a part of [[South Tibet]], which belongs to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

All of these religions have different ''schools'' (ways of thinking) and [[tradition]]s that are related. As a group they are called the [[Eastern religions]]. The Indian religions are similar to one another in many ways: The basic beliefs, the way [[worship]] is done and several religious practices are very similar. These similarities mainly come from the fact that these religions have a common history and common origins. They also influenced each other.

The religion of [[Hinduism]] is the main faith followed by 81.0% of people in the Republic of India; [[Islam]] – 12.8%; [[Christianity]] – 2.9%; Sikhism – 1.9%; [[Buddhism]] – 0.8% and [[Jainism]] – 0.4%.&lt;ref name=&quot;CensusRel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Census of India 2001, Data on Religion |work=Census of India |url=http://www.censusindia.net/religiondata/ |accessdate=April 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Sports in India}}.
India's official national sport is [[field hockey]] which is controlled by the Indian Hockey Federation. The Indian field hockey team won the 1975 Men's Hockey World Cup. They have also won eight gold, one silver and two bronze medals at the [[Olympic games]]. However, [[cricket]] is the most popular sport in India. The India cricket team won the 1983 and 2011 Cricket World Cup and the 2007 ICC World Twenty20. They [[wikt:share|shared]] the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy with [[Sri Lanka]]. Cricket in India is controlled by the Board of Control for Cricket in India or BCCI. Domestic tournaments are the Ranji Trophy, the Duleep Trophy, the Deodhar Trophy, the Irani Trophy and the Challenger Series. There is also the Indian cricket league and Indian premier league Twenty20 competitions.

[[Tennis]] has become popular due to the victories of the India Davis Cup team. [[Association football]] is also a popular sport in northeast India, West Bengal, Goa and Kerala.&lt;ref name = Soccer&gt;{{Harvnb|Majumdar|Bandyopadhyay|2006|pp=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian national football team has won the South Asian Football Federation Cup many times.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An '''insult''' is a description of someone that will [[:wikt:offend|offend]] them. It may or may not be [[truth|true]]. It is called ''derogatory'' language. Terms like [[:wikt:foolish|foolish]], [[:wikt:stupid|stupid]], [[:wikt:idiot|idiot]] and [[:wikt:moron|moron]] are insults, because they say that a person's [[mind]] is not quick or smart.

Insulting someone's mother directly is a serious insult in many [[culture]]s.

[[Ritual]] insults are part of many cultures. For example, they can be found in [[sports]] and [[military training]]. They are also very common in [[jargon]]s. For example, the word ''[[newbie]]'' is a part of [[net jargon]]. Calling someone a newbie is usually insulting.

One should be very careful when using new words to describe others.

==Reason==
Usually, someone insults others because they want to feel like they are better or have more power ([[influence]]) than the people they insult. They may want this because they are actually afraid that they are worse or less powerful than the people they are insulting.

==Effects==
When someone is insulted, his or her [[pride]] is hurt. He or she may want to fight back by insulting the person who insulted him or her.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Immunology''' is the study of the '''[[immune system]]'''. The immune system is the parts of the body which work against [[infection]] and [[parasitism]] by other living things. Immunology deals with the working of the immune system in health and diseases, and with malfunctions of the immune system.

An immune system is present in all plants and animals. We know this because biologists have found genes coding for [[toll-like receptor]]s in many different [[metazoa]]ns.&lt;ref name=Janeway&gt;Janeway, Charles A. 2001. Evolution of the imune system: past, present and future. In Janeway C.A; Travers P; Walport M. &amp; Shlomchik M. 2011. ''Immunobiology: the immune system in health and disease''. 5th ed, Garland, New York. 597{{ndash}}611 ISBN 0-8153-3642-X&lt;/ref&gt; These toll-like receptors can recognise [[bacteria]] as 'foreign', and are the starting-point for immune reactions. The type of immunity which is triggered by the toll-like receptors is called [[innate immunity]]. This is because it is entirely [[Heredity|inherited]] in our [[genome]], and is fully working as soon as our [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] and [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] are properly developed. 

[[Vertebrate]]s, ''and only vertebrates'', have a second type of immunity. This is called [[adaptive immunity]], because it 'remembers' previous infections. Then, if the same infection occurs again, the reaction is much stronger and faster. This immunological memory &quot;confers a tremendous survival advantage&quot; and with it vertebrates &quot;can survive over a long lifetime in a pathogen-filled environment&quot;.&lt;ref name=Janeway/&gt;

== Types of immunity in vertebrates ==
{{main|Immune system}}
=== Innate immune response ===
{{main|Innate immune system}}
The [[innate immune system]] is usually means all of the [[cell]]s and systems that does not have to be exposed to a particular [[pathogen]] before they can work.  

Innate immunity starts with the [[skin]], which is an excellent barrier to [[infection]].

=== Adaptive immune response ===
{{main|Adaptive immune system}}
The [[adaptive immune system]] includes cells and systems that do require previous exposure to a pathogen. It explains the unique ability of the mammalian immune system to remember previous infections and mount a rapid and robust reaction to secondary infections.  This '''immunological memory''' is due to the biology of [[T-cell]]s and [[B-cell]]s.

== Other aspects of immunity ==
[[Vaccine]]s boost the acquired immune system by offering weak forms of infection that the body can fight off. The system remembers how to do it again when a stronger infection happens. If the vaccine works, the body can then fight off a serious infection.

The distribution of vaccines and other immune system affecting [[cure]]s can be considered another level of acquired immune system, one governed by access to [[vaccination]] and [[medicine]] in general.  The intersection of this with the spread of [[disease]] (as studied in [[epidemiology]]) is part of the field of [[public health]].

=== Errors and weaknesses ===
Errors of the immune system may cause damage. In [[autoimmune disease]]s, the body attacks parts of itself because the system mistakes some parts of the body as 'foreign'. Some kinds of [[arthritis]] are caused this way.

Sometimes serious pathogens slip in because their surface is disguised as something the host cell walls can accept. That is how viruses work. Once inside a cell, their genetic material controls the cell. Infections like [[HIV]] get in this way, and then attack cells which are the basis of the immune system. Artificial means are often used to restore immune system function in an HIV-challenged body, and prevent the onset of [[AIDS]].  This is one of the most complex issues in immunology as it involves every level of that system.  This research during the 1980s and 1990s radically changed the view of the human immune system and its functions and integration in the [[human body]].

==History of immunology==


Immunology is a science that examines the structure and function of the immune system. It originates from [[medicine]] and early studies on the causes of immunity to disease. The earliest known mention of immunity was during the [[plague of Athens]] in 430 BC. [[Thucydides]] (460–395 BC) noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of some diseases could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Retief FP, Cilliers L| title=The epidemic of Athens, 430–426 BC| journal=South African Medical Journal |volume=88 |issue=1| pages=50–53 |year=1998 |pmid=9539938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis|Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis]] made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Ostoya P |title=Maupertuis et la biologie| journal=Revue d'histoire des sciences et de leurs applications| year=1954 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=60–78| url= http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rhs_0048-7996_1954_num_7_1_3379 | doi=10.3406/rhs.1954.3379}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This and other observations of acquired immunity led to [[Louis Pasteur]] (1822–1895) developing [[vaccination]] and the [[germ theory of disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Plotkin SA |title=Vaccines: past, present and future |journal=Nature Medicine |volume=11 |issue=4 Suppl |pages=S5–11 |year=2005  |pmid=15812490 |doi=10.1038/nm1209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the [[miasma theory of disease|miasma theory]]. It was not until the proofs [[Robert Koch]] (1843–1910) published in 1891 (for which he was awarded a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in 1905) that [[microorganism]]s were confirmed as the cause of [[infectious disease]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1905/ The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1905], Nobelprize.org, accessed 8 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901, when the [[yellow fever]] virus was discovered by [[Walter Reed]] (1851–1902).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071023070838/www.wramc.amedd&lt;!--
  --&gt;.army.mil/welcome/history/ Major Walter Reed, U.S. Army], Walter Reed Army Medical Center, accessed 8 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Immunology made a great advance towards the end of the 19th century, through rapid developments, in the study of [[humoral immunity]]&lt;ref&gt;In humoral immunity, antibodies are secreted into bodily fluids such as blood and [[lymph]].&lt;/ref&gt; and cellular immunity.&lt;ref name= Metch&gt;{{cite book| last =Mechnikov | first = Ilya| coauthors = translated by F.G. Binnie| title =Immunity in infective diseases| publisher =Cambridge University Press | year =1905 | url= http://books.google.com/?id=ywKp9YhK5t0C&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;vq=Ehrlich&amp;dq=history+of+humoral+immunity| format=full text version: Google Books| isbn=0548-64719-4}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly important was the work of [[Paul Ehrlich]] (1854–1915), who proposed the [[side-chain theory]] to explain the specificity of the antigen-antibody reaction. The Nobel Prize for 1908 was jointly awarded to Ehrlich and the founder of cellular immunology, [[Ilya Mechnikov]] (1845–1916).&lt;ref&gt;
[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1908/ The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1908] Nobelprize.org, accessed 8 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest form of immunity is the [[DNA restriction]] system in [[bacteria]] that prevents [[infection]] by [[bacteriophage]]s.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Infinity''' is about things which never end. Sometimes, it is also written &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;. Infinity means many different things, depending on when it is used. The word is from a [[Latin]] word, which means &quot;without end&quot;. Infinity goes on forever, so sometimes space, numbers, and other things are said to be 'infinite', because they never come to a stop.

Infinity is not really an ordinary number, but it is sometimes used as one. Infinity often says how ''many'' there is of something, instead of how ''big'' something is. For example, there are infinitely many [[whole number]]s (called [[integer]]s), but there is no integer which is infinitely big. But different kinds of math have different kinds of infinity. So its meaning often changes.

There are two kinds of infinity: [[potential]] infinity and [[wikt:actual|actual]] infinity. Potential infinity is a process that never stops. For example, adding 10 to a number. No matter how many times 10 is added, 10 more can still be added. Actual infinity is a more abstract idea. For example, there are infinitely many numbers as it is impossible to write them all down. 

== Infinity in Mathematics ==
[[Mathematicians]] have different sizes of infinity and three different kinds of infinity.&lt;ref name=ax&gt;To simply, we will assume several axioms like the [[Axiom of Choice]] and the [[Generalized Continuum Hypothesis]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counting infinity===
The number of things, beginning with 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., to include infinite cardinal numbers. There are many different cardinal numbers. Infinity can be defined in one of two ways: Infinity is a number so big that a part of it can be of the same size; Infinity is larger than all of the [[natural numbers]]. There is a smallest infinite number, ''countable infinity''. It is the counting number for all of the whole numbers. It is also the counting number of the [[rational numbers]]. The mathematical notation is the Hebrew letter aleph with a subscrpt zero; &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt;. It is spoken &quot;aleph null&quot;. 
It was a surprise to learn that there are larger infinite numbers.&lt;ref name=ax /&gt; The number of [[real numbers]], that is all numbers with decimals, is larger than the number of [[rational numbers]], the number of fractions. This shows that there are real numbers which are not fractions. The smallest infinite number greater than &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;. 
The number of mathematical [[functions]] is the next infinite cardinal number, &lt;math&gt;\aleph_2&lt;/math&gt;.
And these numbers go on without end. 

===Ordering infinity===
A different ''type'' of infinity are the [[ordinal numbers]], beginning &quot;first, second, third, ...&quot;. The order &quot;first, second, third, ...&quot; and so on to infinity is ''different'' from the order ''ending'' &quot;..., third, second, first&quot;. The difference is important for [[mathematical induction]]. The simple ''first, second, third, ... '' has the mathematical name: the Greek letter omega with subscript zero: &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt;. (Or simply omega &lt;math&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \omega&lt;/math&gt;.) The infinite series ending &quot;... third, second, first&quot; is &lt;math&gt; ^*\omega &lt;/math&gt;.

===The real line and complex plane===
The third ''type'' of infinity has the symbol &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;. This is treated as addition to the the [[real numbers]] or the [[complex numbers]]. It is the result of division by zero, or to indicate that a [[series]] is increasing (or decreasing) without bound. The series 1, 2, 3, ... increases without upper bound. This is written: the limit is &lt;math&gt;+\infty&lt;/math&gt;. In [[calculus]], the [[integral]] over all real numbers is written: &lt;math&gt; \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

==The arithmetic of infinity==
Each kind of infinity has different rules.

===Addition, multiplication, exponentiation===

&lt;math&gt;\aleph_0 + 1 = 1 + \aleph_0 = \aleph_0 + \aleph_0 = \aleph_0 &lt;/math&gt; Addition with &quot;alephs&quot; is [[commutative]].  

&lt;math&gt; 2 \times \aleph_0 = \aleph_0 \times 2 = \aleph_0 \times \aleph_0 = \aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; Multiplication with &quot;alephs&quot; is commutative.

&lt;math&gt; \aleph_0 + \aleph_1 = \aleph_1 \times \aleph_0 = \aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 2 ^ {\aleph_0} = \aleph_1 &lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=ax /&gt;.

&lt;math&gt; 1 + \omega = \omega \neq \omega +1 &lt;/math&gt;. Addition with &quot;omegas&quot; is not commutative.

&lt;math&gt; 2 \times \omega = \omega \neq \omega \times 2 &lt;/math&gt;. Multiplication with &quot;omegas&quot; is not commutative.

&lt;math&gt; \omega + \omega = \omega \times 2 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; x + \infty = \infty = \infty + \infty = \infty \times \infty = 2 ^ \infty &lt;/math&gt;

===Subtraction, division===

'''January''' is the first [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] calendars. It has 31 [[day]]s. 

January is named for [[Janus]], the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[god]] of [[door]]s and [[gate]]s.

January and [[February]] were put on the [[calendar]] after all the other months. This is because in the original Roman calendar, [[winter]] did not have months. Although [[March]] was originally the first month, January became the new first month because that was when people chose the new [[Roman Republic|consul]]s (Roman leaders).

January's flower is the [[carnation]] with its [[birthstone]] being the [[garnet]]. The meaning of the garnet is constancy.

The first day of January is called [[New Year's Day]]. In some countries it has the name of [[Saint Sylvester]].

[[File:Gaius Julius Caesar (100-44 BC).JPG|thumb|130px|right|July is named after [[Julius Caesar]], who was born on 12 or 13 July]]
In each hemisphere, it is the [[season]]al equivalent of [[January]] in the other hemisphere. In the North, it is [[summer]] and in the South it is [[winter]].

In the [[Northern Hemisphere]], July is often the warmest month of the year, and major [[sport]]ing events and [[music]] festivals are held around this time. In the [[Southern Hemisphere]], it is a winter month, with the [[cold]]est-recorded temperature having been measured in [[Antarctica]] in this month.

July begins on the same day of the week as [[April]] in [[common year]]s and also [[January]] in [[leap year]]s. It ends on the same day of week as [[January]] in [[leap year]]s, while in common years, no month ends on the same day of the week as July.

July's [[flower]] is a variety of the [[Nymphaeaceae|water lily]]. Its [[birthstone]] is the [[ruby]]. The meaning for the birthstone ruby is contented mind. [[Astrology|Astrological]] signs for July are [[Cancer (constellation)|Cancer]] ([[June 22]] - [[July 23]]) and [[Leo (constellation)|Leo]] ([[July 24]] - [[August 22]]).

In the old [[Roman calendar]], July was called ''Quintilis'', meaning ''Fifth Month'' because, in the old calendar, the year began in [[March]]. [[Augustus]] later renamed it July in honour of [[Julius Caesar]], whose birthday was in this month. [[Augustus]] later also named the following month, [[August]], after himself.

{{wiktionary|Japan}}
'''Japan''' (日本, Nippon) is a [[country]] in [[Asia]]. It has many [[island]]s. Four of them are big, and the biggest is the 7th largest island in the [[world]]. This island is called [[Honshu]]. The islands are near the east Asian coast, in the western part of the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name='CIA Factbook' /&gt;

Japanese [[people]] call their country &quot;Nihon&quot; or &quot;Nippon&quot;,&lt;ref name='CIA Factbook'&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ja.html |title=Japan |accessdate=2009-06-16 |work=CIA World Factbook |publisher=[[CIA]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; which means &quot;the origin of the sun&quot; in Japanese. Japan does not have a King or Queen, instead it has an Emperor and an Empress. 

==History==
{{Main|History of Japan}}
The earliest records on Japan are from [[China|Chinese]] documents. One of those records said there were many small countries (in Japan) which had wars between them and later a country, ruled by a queen, became the strongest, unified others and peace came.

The Japanese began to write their own history after the [[5th century|5th]] and [[6th century|6th centuries]], when people from [[Korea]] and China taught Japan about the [[Chinese writing system]]. Japan's neighbours also showed them the ways of [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name='Japan history'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2131.html |title=Early Japan (until 710) |accessdate=2009-06-16 |work=japan-guide.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese changed Buddhism in many ways, for example, by building strongly on ideas such as [[Zen]], which came from mainland Asia.&lt;ref name='Japan history' /&gt;

In the ancient and the [[Middle Ages]], China gave Japan many new cultural ideas, but their friendship became weaker later. In the late [[13th century]], [[Mongol Empire|Mongolians]] from China tried to invade Japan twice, but they could not.&lt;br /&gt;
The [[samurai]] and [[shogun]] of Medieval Japan are similar to knights and lords in Medieval [[Europe]].

Japan had some contact with the Europeans in the [[16th century]]. The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] were the first Europeans to visit Japan. Later, the [[Spain|Spanish]], [[England|English]] and [[Holland|Dutch]] came to Japan to trade. Also, they brought [[Christianity]]. Japan's leaders welcomed them at first, but because Europeans had conquered many places in the world, the Japanese were scared they would conquer Japan too. So the Japanese did not let the Europeans come into Japan anymore, except in a small area in [[Nagasaki]] city. Many Christians were killed. Only Chinese, Korean and Dutch people were allowed to visit Japan, in the end, and they were under careful control of the Japanese government. Japan was opened for visitors again in [[1854]] by Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry|Matthew Perry]], when the [[United States|Americans]] wanted to use Japanese ports for American [[whale]] boats. Perry brought steamships with guns, which scared the Japanese into making an agreement with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/teach/ends/opening.htm |title=Perry &amp; Opening of Japan |work=history.navy.mil |year=2009 [last update] |accessdate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new contact with Europeans and Americans changed the Japanese culture. The [[Meiji Restoration]] of [[1868]] stopped some old ways and added many new ones. The [[Empire of Japan]] was created, and it became a very powerful nation and tried to invade the countries next to it. It invaded and [[annexation|annexed]] [[Ryukyu Islands|Ryukyu]] Kingdom, [[Taiwan]], and Korea. It had wars with China and Russia: the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], the [[Boxer Rebellion]] the [[Russo-Japanese War]], and the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], which grew to become a part of [[World War II]].

In 1941, Japan hit [[Pearl Harbor]] in [[Hawaii]], a water base of the United States and destroyed or damaged many ships and airplanes. This started the United States' involvement in [[World War II]]. American and Japanese forces fought each other in the Pacific. Once airbases were established within range of the Japanese mainland America began to win, and started dropping bombs on Japanese cities. America was able to bomb most of the important cities and quickly brought Japan close to defeat. To make Japan surrender, the United States dropped two [[atomic bomb]]s on the cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], killing 150,000 Japanese citizens. Soon after this the [[Soviet Union]] began to fight against Japan and the Japanese army in [[Manchuria]] lost. Japan surrendered and gave up all the places it took from other countries, accepting the [[Potsdam Conference|Potsdam]] Proclamation. The United States occupied Japan and forced it to write a new [[constitution]], in which it promised to never go to war again.

==Geography==
[[File:Mountfujijapan.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Fuji]] with [[cherry blossom]] trees and a [[shinkansen]] in the foreground—all three are iconic of Japan]]
Japan is a group of islands in the Western [[Pacific]], off the coast of China. The four biggest islands are [[Honshu]], [[Hokkaido]], [[Shikoku]], and [[Kyushu]], and there are about 6,000 smaller islands there. Japan is separated from the Asian continent by the [[Sea of Japan]] and the East China Sea. Honshu, which means 'Mainland' in the [[Japanese language]], is the biggest island. Hokkaido is the island north of Honshu. Kyushu is the island west of Honshu. Shikoku is the island to the south-west of Honshu.&lt;ref name='CIA Factbook' /&gt;

In the middle of Japan there are mountains.&lt;ref name='CIA Factbook' /&gt; They cover the middle of the islands and leave a very narrow strip of flat land on most coasts. Many of the mountains are extinct [[volcano]]es, but some are still active. The highest of these mountains is the beautiful, volcano-shaped Mt Fuji (3776m or 12,389 feet high). Japan has many earthquakes, in fact there are about 1500 of these every year.&lt;ref name='CIA Factbook' /&gt; The most recent big earthquake was in 2011 - called '2011 Tohoku Earthquake'. It caused great damage to several power plants forcing Japan to shut down all its nuclear plants. There was nuclear core meltdown which caused a serious health risk to nearby villages and cities.

90% of the people living in Japan live in just 10% of the [[land]], near the coast. The other 10% of the people in Japan live away from the coast.

Over 10 cities have more than a million people in them. The biggest city in Japan is [[Tokyo]], which is the capital.
[[File:Skyscrapers of Shinjuku 2009 January.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Tokyo]]]]

==Politics and Government==
The ruling party is the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)]] and prime minister is [[Shinzo Abe]].

==Science and technology==
In the past, much [[science]] in Japan was learnt either from [[China]], or from [[Europe]] in the [[Meiji Era]]. However in recent decades Japan has been a leading innovator in several fields, including [[chemical engineering]], nanotechnology and robotics. There are many technological companies in Japan, and these companies make products for export.

The robot Asimo was made and introduced in 2000. It was manufactured by [[Honda]].

==Society and culture==
Many things in Japanese culture originated in [[China]], for example [[Go]], and [[bonsai]].

Japan's traditional food is [[seafood]], rice, [[miso soup]], and vegetables. [[Noodles]] and [[tofu]] are also common. [[Sushi]], a Japanese food made of cooked rice with [[vinegar]] with other ingredients such as raw fish, is popular around the world.

See also [[Tea ceremony]], [[Noh]], [[Kabuki]], [[manga]], [[anime]], [[puppet|Bunraku]].

The religion in Japan is mostly [[Shinto]] and [[Buddhist]]. There are small numbers of [[Christian]]s and [[Muslim]]s, and a few [[Jew]]s.

* [[Senkaku Islands]] problem (with [[China]] and [[Taiwan]])
* [[Liancourt Rocks]] island problem (with [[South Korea]])
* Southern [[Chishima Islands]] problem (with [[Russia]])
* [[Sea of Japan]] problem (with [[South Korea]] and [[North Korea]])

==Public transportation==
[[File:JR Central Shinkansen 700.jpg|thumb|left|High speed [[Shinkansen]] or ''Bullet trains'' are a common form of transportation in Japan.]]

There are several important international airports in Japan. [[Narita]] is the major international airport in the Tokyo area. Kansai International Airport serves as the main airport for [[Osaka]], [[Kobe]], and [[Kyoto]]. [[Chūbu Centrair International Airport]] near [[Nagoya]] is the newest of the three. [[Haneda Airport]] is close to central Tokyo and is the largest domestic airport in the country.

The [[Shinkansen]] is one of the fastest trains in the world and connects cities in Honshu and Kyushu. Networks of public and private railways are almost all over the country. People mostly travel between cities in buses.

==Subdivisions==
[[File:Region system8.png|230px|thumb|Prefectures in Japan]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Jargon''' is a special way to use words that are shared only by a certain group of people.  They do not mean what the [[dictionary]] says they mean.  They have different meanings to the people using them than their everyday meaning.

For example, the ordinary words ''boot'', ''net'', and ''web'' also have special meanings for users of [[computer]]s, the [[Internet]], and the [[World Wide Web]].  These, and to [[flame]], to [[ping]] and many [[acronym]]s are part of [[Internet slang|net jargon]].

An ''acronym'' means that only some of the letters in the word or phrase are used.  Often this is the first letter of each word. Other acronyms found online are simply common shorthand. See [[list of slang words]].

Usually, more jargon is [[create]]d over time.

Jargon is also common in the [[military]]. It includes [[phrase]]s like [[SNAFU]].

Jargon can be used by a [[clique]] to prevent others from joining or understanding, but it also is often just used because it is shorter.

'''Jupiter''' is the largest [[planet]] in the [[Solar System]].&lt;ref&gt;'Jupiter' is pronounced {{Audio-IPA|en-us-Jupiter.ogg|[ˈdʒuːpɨtɚ]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nasabook /&gt; It is the fifth planet from the [[Sun]]. Jupiter is classified as a [[gas giant]], both because it is so large and due to the fact that it is made up mostly of [[gas]]. The other gas giants are [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]], [[Uranus (planet)|Uranus]], and [[Neptune (planet)|Neptune]]. 

Jupiter has a [[mass]] of 1.8986×10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[Kilogram|kg]], or about 318 Earths.&lt;ref name=&quot;fact&quot;/&gt; This is twice the mass of all the other planets in the Solar System put together.&lt;ref name=nasabook /&gt;

Jupiter can be seen with the naked eye. It was known to the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]], who named it after their god [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]] ([[Latin]]: ''Iuppiter'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Jupiter has at least 67 [[Satellite (natural)|moons]]. Of these, 55 are very small and less than five [[Kilometre|kilometres]] wide. The four largest [[moons of Jupiter]] are [[Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], and [[Callisto]]. They are collectively called the [[Galilean moons]], because they were discovered by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[astronomer]] [[Galileo Galilei]]. Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System.

== Structure ==
Jupiter is the biggest planet in the Solar System with a [[wikt:diameter|diameter]] of 142,984&amp;nbsp;[[km]]. This is eleven times bigger than the diameter of Earth.&lt;ref name=nasabook /&gt;
[[File:PIA02863 - Jupiter surface motion animation.gif|thumb|right|An [[animation]] of part of Jupiter's cloud system. The animation is made of over 40 [[photograph]]s taken by the [[Cassini-Huygens|Cassini]] [[spacecraft]] between October 31 and November 9, 2000.]]

[[File:Voyager.jpg|thumb|right|A picture by an [[artist]] of the [[Voyager 1]] spacecraft that flew past Jupiter in 1979.]]

=== Atmosphere ===
The [[atmosphere]] near the [[wikt:surface|surface]] of Jupiter is made of about 88 to 92% [[hydrogen]], 8 to 12% [[helium]], and 1% other gases.&lt;ref name=fact /&gt; 

Further into the planet it is so hot and the [[pressure]] so high that helium [[condensation|becomes a liquid]] and [[precipitation|precipitates]] or [[rain]]s further down into the planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.archive.org/web/20090410221648/http://ael.gsfc.nasa.gov/jupiterHighlights.shtml |title=Highlights of the Galileo Probe Mass Spectrometer Investigation |accessdate=2013-08-23 |format= |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on [[spectroscopy]], Jupiter seems to be made of similar gases to [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]. It is not as similar to [[Neptune (planet)|Neptune]] or [[Uranus (planet)|Uranus]]. These two planets have much less hydrogen and helium gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The very high [[temperature]]s and [[pressure]]s in Jupiter's core mean [[scientist]]s cannot tell what [[material]]s would be there. This cannot be found out, because it is not possible to create the same amount of pressure on Earth. 

Above the unknown inner core is an outer core. The outer core of Jupiter is thick, liquid [[hydrogen]].&lt;ref name=nasabook /&gt; The pressure is high enough to make the hydrogen [[solid]], but then it [[melting|melts]] because of the heat.

=== Mass ===
Jupiter is twice as [[mass]]ive as all the other planets in the Solar System put together.&lt;ref name=nasabook&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/worldbook/jupiter_worldbook.html |title=Jupiter - A world book |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt; It gives off more [[heat]] than it gets from the [[sun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Jupiter is 11 times the width of Earth and 318 times as massive. The [[volume]] of Jupiter is 1,317 times the volume of Earth. In other words, 1,317 Earth-sized objects could fit inside it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/SEH/jupiter.html|title=Jupiter|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cloud layers ===
Jupiter has many bands of [[cloud]]s going [[wikt:horizontal|horizontally]] across its surface. The light parts are called zones and the darker are called belts. The zones and belts often [[wikt:interaction|interact]] with each other. This causes huge [[storm]]s. [[Wind]] speeds of 360&amp;nbsp;[[kilometres per hour]] (km/h) are common on Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/~showman/publications/ingersolletal-2004.pdf |title=Dynamics of Jupiter's atmosphere |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=The University of Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt; To show the difference the strongest [[tropical storm]]s on Earth are about 100&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.weathersa.co.za/References/Cyclones.jsp|title=Tropical cyclones|publisher=Weather South Africa|accessdate=2009-07-19|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/652Gwj0pZ|archivedate=2011-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the clouds on Jupiter are made of [[ammonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.solarviews.com/eng/jupiter.htm|title=Jupiter|accessdate=2009-07-20|publisher=Solar View}}&lt;/ref&gt; There may also be clouds of [[water vapour]] similar to clouds on Earth. [[Spacecraft]]s such as [[Voyager 1]] have seen [[lightning]] on the surface of the planet. Scientists think it was water vapour because lightning needs water vapour.&lt;ref name=nasagal /&gt; These lightning bolts have been measured as up 1,000 times as powerful as those on Earth.&lt;ref name=nasagal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/universe/solarsystem/galileo_end.html |title=Surprising Jupiter - Busy Galileo spacecraft showed jovian system is full of surprises |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[brown]] and [[orange]] colours are caused when sunlight passes through or [[refraction|refracts]] with the many gases in the [[atmosphere]].

=== Great Red Spot ===
One of the biggest features in Jupiter's [[atmosphere]] is the [[Great Red Spot]]. It is a huge [[storm]] which is bigger than the entire [[Earth]]. It has been known about for just under 200 years and possibly even longer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Magnetic field ===
Jupiter has a [[magnetic field]] similar to Earth's but 11 times stronger.&lt;ref name=nasabook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/jupiter/magnetic.html|title=The Magnetic Field of Jupiter|publisher=AstroWiki|accessdate=2009-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also has what is known as a ''[[magnetosphere]]''. The strength of the field is enough to be a serious danger to any [[spacecraft]] travelling past or to Jupiter. The magnetic field is probably caused by the large amounts of liquid [[metal]]lic [[hydrogen]] in the core of Jupiter.&lt;ref name=nasabook /&gt; The four largest moons of Jupiter [[orbit]] or go around the planet within the magnetic field. This protects them from the [[solar wind]]. Jupiter's magnetic field is so large, it reaches the orbit of [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]] 7.7 million [[miles]] away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astrophysicsspectator.com/topics/planets/JupiterMagnetosphere.html |title=Jupiter's Magnetosphere |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |work= |publisher=Astrophysics Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Earth]]'s magnetosphere does not even cover its [[moon]], less than a quarter of a million miles away.
==== Ring system ====
{{main article|Rings of Jupiter}}
Jupiter also has a thin [[planetary ring]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/316306main_JunoFactSheet_2009sm.pdf|format=PDF|page=2|title=Juno Mission to Jupiter|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2011-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rings are very difficult to see, and so they were not discovered until [[NASA]]'s [[Voyager 1]] probe went to Jupiter in 1979.&lt;ref name=nsse/&gt; There are four parts to Jupiter's rings. The closest ring to Jupiter is called the Halo Ring.&lt;ref name=&quot;roj&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.windows2universe.org/jupiter/rings.html&amp;edu=high |title=The Rings of Jupiter - Halo, Main and Gossamer RIng - Composition |first=Randy |last=Russell |work=windows2universe.org |year=2012|accessdate=2012-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next ring is called the Main Ring. It is about {{convert|6440|km|mi|0|lk=off|abbr=on}} wide and only {{convert|30|km|mi|0|lk=off|abbr=on}} thick.&lt;ref name=&quot;roj&quot;/&gt; The Main and Halo rings of Jupiter are made of small, dark particles.&lt;ref name=nsse&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sse.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/profile.cfm?Object=Jupiter&amp;Display=OverviewLong|title=NASA: Solar System Exploration: Planets: Jupiter:  Read More|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The third and fourth rings, called the ''Gossamer'' Rings, are [[transparent]] (see through) and are made from [[microscopic]] debris and dust.&lt;ref name=nsse/&gt; This dust probably comes from small meteors striking the surface of Jupiter's moons. The third ring is called the Amalthea Gossamer Ring, named after moon [[Amalthea (moon)|Amalthea]]. The outer ring, the Thebe Gossamer Ring, is named after the moon [[Thebe (moon)|Thebe]]. The outer edge of this ring is about {{convert|220000|km|mi|0|lk=off|abbr=on}} from Jupiter.&lt;ref name=&quot;roj&quot;/&gt;

== Orbit ==
The [[orbit]] of a planet is the time and path it takes to go around the [[Sun]]. In the amount of time it takes for Jupiter to orbit the Sun one time, the Earth orbits the Sun 11.86 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://zebu.uoregon.edu/~soper/Orbits/jupiterorbit.html |title=Jupiter's path in the sky |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=The Electronic Universe}}&lt;/ref&gt; One [[year]] on Jupiter is equal to 11.86 years on Earth. The [[wikt:average|average]] distance between Jupiter and the Sun is 778 million [[kilometre]]s. This is five times the distance between [[Earth]] and the Sun. Jupiter is not tilted on its [[Cartesian coordinate system|axis]] as much as the Earth or [[Mars]]. This causes it to have no seasons, for example [[Summer]] or [[Winter]]. Jupiter rotates, or spins around very quickly.&lt;ref name=nasabook /&gt; This causes the planet to [[wikt:bulge|bulge]] in the middle. Jupiter is the fastest spinning planet in the Solar System. It completes one rotation or spin in 10 hours.&lt;ref name=nasabook /&gt; Because of the bulge, the length of the [[equator]] of Jupiter is much longer than the length from [[Geographical pole|pole]] to pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ase.tufts.edu/cosmos/view_chapter.asp?id=9&amp;page=3 |title=Jupiter: a giant primitive planet |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=NASA's Cosmos }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and exploration ==
=== From Earth ===
Jupiter is the third brightest object in the night sky, after [[the Moon]] and [[Venus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;unaidedeye&quot;/&gt; Because of that, people have always been able to see it from Earth. The first person known to really study the planet was [[Galileo Galilei]] in 1610.&lt;ref name=Galileo /&gt; He was the first person to see Jupiter's [[Natural satellite|moons]] [[Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], [[Ganymede]] and [[Callisto]].&lt;ref name=Galileo&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/ganymede/discovery.html|title=Jupiter|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was because he used a [[telescope]], unlike anyone before him.

No new moons were discovered for more than two hundred years. In 1892, [[astronomer]] [[E.E Barnard]] found a new moon using his [[observatory]] in [[California]]. He called the moon [[Amalthea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phys-astro.sonoma.edu/BruceMedalists/Barnard/ |title=Edward Emerson Barnard |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=The Bruce Medalists }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the last of Jupiter's 67 moons to be discovered by [[human]] observation through a [[telescope]].&lt;ref name=Galileo /&gt;
In 1994, bits of the [[comet]] [[Shoemaker Levy-9]] hit Jupiter. It was the first time a collision or crash between two [[Solar System]] objects had been directly seen by [[humans|people]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoemaker-Levy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/sl9/ |title=Comet Shoemaker-Levy Collision with Jupiter |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From spacecraft ===
Eight [[spacecraft]] have either flown past or visited Jupiter since 1973.&lt;ref name=nasabook /&gt; These were [[Pioneer 10]] (1973), [[Pioneer 11]] (1974), Voyagers [[Voyager 1|1]] and [[Voyager 2|2]] (1979), [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]] (1992 and 2004), [[Cassini-Huygens|Cassini]] (2000) and [[New Horizons]] in 2007. 

The Pioneer missions were the first spacecraft to take close up pictures of Jupiter and its moons. Five years later, the two Voyager spacecraft discovered over 20 new moons. They captured [[Photography|photo]] [[evidence]] of [[lightning]] on the night side of Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981JGR....86.8713G |title=The helium abundance of Jupiter from Voyager |accessdate=2009-07-20 |publisher=Harvard University |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]] probe was sent to study the [[Sun]]. It only went to Jupiter after it had finished its main mission. Ulysses had no [[camera]]s so it took no photographs.
In 2006, the Cassini spacecraft, on its way to [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]], took some very good, very clear pictures of the planet. Cassini also found a moon and took a picture of it but it was too far away to show the details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004Icar..172....1H |title=The Cassini-Huygens flyby of Jupiter |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=Harvard University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Galileo mission in 1995 was the only spacecraft to go into [[orbit]] around Jupiter. It flew around the planet for seven years and studied all of the four biggest moons. It launched a probe into the planet to get [[information]] about Jupiter's atmosphere. The probe travelled to a depth of about 150&amp;nbsp;km before it was crushed by the weight of all the [[gas]] above it.&lt;ref name=Gal2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/galileo/ |title=Galileo End of Mission Status |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is called [[pressure]]. The Galileo spacecraft was also crushed in 2003 when [[NASA]] [[steer]]ed the craft into the planet on purpose. They did this so that the craft could not crash into [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], a [[Satellite (natural)|moon]] which [[scientist]]s think might have [[life]].&lt;ref name=Gal2 /&gt;

=== Future ===
[[NASA]] have sent another spacecraft to Jupiter called [[Juno (spacecraft)|Juno]]. It was launched on  August 5, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/launch/index.html|title=Juno Launch|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2011-07-05|first=Tony|last=Greicius|date=2011-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft will go into orbit around the planet in July 2016.&lt;ref name=NASAJunoFact&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/juno/overview/index.html|accessdate=2011-03-05|publisher=NASA|title=NASA Home: Missions: Juno: Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several missions have been planned to send spacecraft to Jupiter's [[Satellite (natural)|moons]] [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Callisto]]. One called JIMO (Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter) was cancelled in 2006 because it cost too much [[money]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6928404/ |title=White House scales back space plans |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=MSN }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moons ==
{{main|Moons of Jupiter}}

Jupiter has 67 known moons.&lt;ref name=fact /&gt; The four largest  were seen by [[Galileo]] with his primitive telescope, and nine more can be seen from Earth with modern telescopes. The rest of the moons have been identified by spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/append7.html#JovianSystem|title=Jovian System|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey|accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smallest moon ([[S/2003 J 12]]) is only one [[kilometre]] across. The largest, [[Ganymede]], has a diameter of 5,262 kilometres. It is bigger than the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nineplanets.org/ganymede.html |title=Ganymede |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=Nine Planets }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other three Galilean moons are [[Io]], [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] and [[Callisto]]. Because of the way they orbit Jupiter, [[gravity]] affects three of these moons greatly. The [[friction]] caused by the gravity of Europa and Ganymede pulling on Io makes it the most [[volcanoes|volcanic]] object in the Solar System. It has over 400 volcanoes, more than three times as many as [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004Icar..169..140L |title=Lava lakes on Io: observations of Io's volcanic activity from Galileo NIMS during the 2001 fly-bys |accessdate=2009-07-20 |format= |publisher=Harvard University }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jupiter in the Solar System ==
[[File:InnerSolarSystem-en.png|thumb|A diagram of the inner Solar System. It shows the two groups of [[Trojan asteroid]]s that follow Jupiter in its orbit]]
Jupiter's large gravity has had a big effect on the [[Solar System]]. Jupiter protects the inner planets from [[comet]]s by pulling them towards itself. Because of this, Jupiter has the most comet impacts in the Solar System.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shoemaker-Levy&quot;/&gt;

Two groups of [[asteroid]]s, called [[Trojan asteroid]]s, have settled into Jupiter's orbit round the Sun. One group is called the ''Trojans'' and the other group is called the ''Greeks''. They go around the Sun at the same time as Jupiter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Planetary science: The Trojan is out there | first=Alison | last=Wright | journal=Nature Physics | volume=7 | page=592 | year=2011 | doi=10.1038/nphys2061 | date=August 1, 2011 | url=http://www.nature.com/nphys/journal/v7/n8/full/nphys2061.html | accessdate=2011-08-12 |bibcode = 2011NatPh...7..592W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robutel P. &amp; Souchay J. 2010. &quot;An introduction to the dynamics of trojan asteroids&quot;, in Dvorak, Rudolf &amp; Souchay, Jean ''Dynamics of small Solar System bodies and exoplanets''.

A '''king''' is a [[man]] who rules a [[country]], because of [[inheritance]]. A king usually comes to power when the previous [[monarch]] dies, who is usually a family member of his. Sometimes a person may become king due to the previous monarch's [[abdication]], for example [[George VI]]. For most of history, most countries were ruled in this way, especially in Europe. Some countries, such as France, are no longer monarchies. Some, such as the [[United Kingdom]], still have a [[royal family]]. In some countries, people chose a new king from other people to decide from. 

The wife of a king is called a [[queen]]. A woman who becomes a [[ruler]] because of inheritance is also called a queen.

If a country has a king or a queen, that means it is a [[monarchy]]. A country which a king or queen rules is called a kingdom.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Knowledge''' means the things which are [[true]], as opposed to [[opinion]]. [[Information]] which is correct is knowledge. Knowledge can always be supported by [[evidence]], because that is how the word is used. If a statement is not supported by evidence, then it is not knowledge. The evidence makes it justified; it is not an opinion or a guess.

If someone understands an idea or is aware of something, then he or she has knowledge of it. When it makes sense to someone, this knowledge becomes ''understanding''. A knowledgeable person is someone who knows a lot. If someone has know-how it means that they can put knowledge to work in doing or building something.

== Where it comes from ==
Knowledge comes from being in an [[environment]], having some [[experience]] there, and then sharing what was learned. That way others may gain from what someone else knows.

== Types of knowledge ==
When doing [[science]], it may be necessary to set up a strict [[experiment]]. Then the experience is repeatable and others may repeat it afterwards. 

=== Other types of knowledge ===
Other types of knowledge can be for a more specific [[wikt:purpose|purpose]], for example learning a language. In [[business]], [[computer]]s help to [[record]] and share what [[employee]]s know.

==Religion and knowledge ==
In many expressions of [[Christianity]], such as [[Catholicism]] and [[Anglicanism]], knowledge is one of the seven gifts of the [[Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p3s1c1a7.htm#1831
|title=Part Three, No. 1831
|work=Catechism of the Catholic Church
|accessdate=2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[Garden of Eden]] knowledge is the factor that made humans greedy and treacherous. But in the [[Book of Proverbs]] it states: 'to be wise you must first obey the LORD' (9:10)

In Islam, knowledge (Arabic: علم, ''ʿilm'') is given great significance. &quot;The All-Knowing&quot; (''al-ʿAlīm'') is one of the Names of God, reflecting distinct properties of God in Islam. The [[Qur'an]] asserts that knowledge comes from God ({{cite quran|2|239|style=nosup|expand=no}}) and various ''[[hadith]]'' encourage getting knowledge. [[Muhammad]] is reported to have said &quot;Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave&quot; and &quot;Verily the men of knowledge are the inheritors of the prophets&quot;. Islamic scholars, theologians and jurists are often given the title ''alim'', meaning 'knowledgeable'.

'''Kauai''' ('''Kaua'i''' in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]) is the oldest and fourth largest of the main [[Hawaiian Islands]], in the [[United States]]. Known also as the &quot;Garden Isle&quot;, Kaua'i lies 105 miles (170 kilometers) across the Kaua'i Channel, northwest of [[Honolulu]] on [[Oahu|O'ahu]]. It is of [[volcano|volcanic]] origin. The highest point is [[Mount Waialeale]], at the center of the island, 5,148 feet (1,570 meters) above sea level. The wettest spot on Earth, with average rainfall of 460 inches (11,648 millimeters) a year, is just east of Mount Waialeale. The high yearly rainfall has eroded deep valleys in the central mountain. It has made canyons with many scenic waterfalls.

The city of [[Lihue, Hawaii|Lihue]], on the island's southeast side, is the seat of [[Kauai County, Hawaii|Kauai County]]. It is the main city on the island. [[Waimea, Hawaii|Waimea]], on the island's southwest side and once the capital of Kauai, was the first place visited by explorer Captain [[James Cook]] in [[1778]]. The city is at the head of one of the most beautiful canyons in the world, [[Waimea Canyon]], whose gorge is 900 meters (3,000 feet) deep.

The island of Kauai was featured in Disney's [[2002]] [[animated feature film]] ''[[Lilo &amp; Stitch]]''.

'''Kaho{{okina}}olawe''' is the smallest of the 8 main [[volcano|volcanic]] islands in the [[Hawaiian Islands]], in the [[United States]].  It is west of [[Maui]] and south of [[Lanai|Lana{{okina}}i]] and is 11 miles long by {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=on}} across ({{convert|45|sqmi|km2|disp=or|abbr=on}}). The highest point, Lua Makika, is {{convert|1477|ft|m}} above sea level. The island is rather dry because its low height does not cause much [[rain]] ([[orographic precipitation]]) to fall from the northeastern [[trade winds]].

Kaho{{okina}}olawe was used as a gunfire and bombing target by the United States [[military]] because of [[World War II]], and a defense training area by the [[United States Navy]] from around 1941 until May 1994.  Popular feeling in Hawai{{okina}}i against this practice finally won, and the Navy has been trying to finish a cleanup of unexploded ordnance (bombs and explosive shells) from the island.  Ordnance is still buried or lying on the ground. Other items have washed down gullies and still other unexploded ordnance is underwater offshore. In 1981, the entire island was included on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The island is planned to be given back to the Hawaiian people.  In 1993, the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] passed a law that &quot;recognized the cultural importance of the island, required the Navy to return the island to the State, and directed the Navy to do an unexploded ordnance (UXO) cleanup and environmental restoration&quot; [http://www.state.hi.us/kirc/main/home.htm]. The turnover officially occurred on [[November 11]], [[2003]], but the cleanup has not yet been completed. The U.S. Navy was given $400 million and 10 years to complete the large cleanup task, but this work has gone much slower than planned.

In 1993, the [[Hawaii]] State [[Legislature]] established the Kaho{{okina}}olawe Island Reserve. It is made up of the whole island and waters out to {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on}} from shore. By State Law, Kaho{{okina}}olawe and its waters can only be used for Native Hawaiian [[cultural]], [[spiritual]], and [[subsistence]] purposes; fishing; [[environmental restoration]]; [[historic preservation]]; and [[education]]. Commercial uses are not allowed. The Legislature also created the Kaho{{okina}}olawe Island Reserve Commission (KIRC) to manage the Reserve while it is held in trust for a &quot;future Native Hawaiian Sovereignty entity&quot; [http://www.state.hi.us/kirc/main/home.htm]. 

After the cleanup is finished, the restoration of Kaho{{okina}}olawe will need ways to control [[erosion]], restore the plant life, recharge the [[water table]], and slowly replace alien plants with native ones. Plans will include methods for damming gullies and reducing rainwater runoff. Non-natives will temporarily stabilize some areas before the permanent planting of native plants.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The act of '''killing''' a [[life form|living thing]] can be said to have happened when an outside [[force]], usually another life form, has done something to cause it to [[death|die]].

When a [[human being]] is killed by another human being, this event is called a [[homicide]], [[manslaughter]], [[hero]]ism in time of [[war]], or [[abortion]]. When a human being chooses to be killed by their own actions, it is called a [[suicide]].

A kill is also the act of shooting down a [[fighter aircraft]].
The word kill is very serious; it means that someone might soon meet their death if they are not careful. People who kill others are called [[murderers]]. 

When a [[President]] kills people with a [[drone]], it is called 'defending the homeland'. When the [[state]] kills a criminal, it is called [[Capital punishment]]. When someone kills a [[politician]] it is called [[assassination]]. When a person who wants to die is killed by another, it is called [[euthanasia]]. When people watch people killing each other on [[television]], it is called [[crime fiction|crime drama]] or [[entertainment]]. When people kill other people to eat them, it is called [[cannibalism]].

The '''kilometre''' is a common [[Unit of measurement|unit]] used for longer [[distance]]s on [[Earth]]. The [[SI|international unit]] for measuring distances is the [[metre]] and a kilometre is 1000 metres. It is used in some countries for measuring road and sea distances. In the [[UK]] and the [[USA]], the [[mile]] is used more than kilometres for road distances and the [[nautical mile]] for sea distances.

It is often used to measure the speed of cars, planes and boats by saying how many kilometres it can travel in an hour. This is shown as km/h.

It is also spelled '''kilometer'''. This spelling is used in [[American English]].

One kilometre is 0.6214 miles (3280.84 feet). This means that one mile is 1.6093 kilometres.

One kilometre is the approximate distance a healthy adult human being can walk in ten [[minute]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Language''' is the normal way [[human]]s [[communication|communicate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;&gt;''Concise Oxford dictionary''. p764&lt;/ref&gt; Only [[human]]s use language, though many other animals communicate in various ways. 

Human language has [[syntax]], a set of [[rule]]s for connecting [[word]]s together to make [[Proposition|statements]] and [[question]]. Language can also be changed, by adding new words, for example, to describe new things. Other animals may inherit a set of calls which have pre-set functions. 

Language may be done by [[speech]] or by [[writing]] or by moving the hands to make [[Sign language|signs]]. It follows that language is ''not'' just any way of communicating. Even some human communication is not language: see [[non-verbal communication]]. Humans also use language for [[thought|thinking]].

Language is a word that may be used by extension: 
# The language of a [[community]] or [[country]].
# The faculty of [[speech]].
# [[Formal language]] in [[mathematics]], [[logic]] and [[computing]].
# [[Sign language]] for deaf people (people who cannot hear).
# A type of [[school]] subject.

[[UNESCO]] says that 2,500 languages are at risk of becoming [[extinction|extinct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/guide/languages.shtml | title=BBC Languages | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate=February 04, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Universals of language ==
All languages share certain things which separate them from all other kinds of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Scalise, Sergio; Magni, Elisabetta; Bisetto, Antonietta (eds) 2009. ''Universals of language today''. Studies in Natural Language and Linguistic Theory, vol 76. Springer Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chao&quot;&gt;Yuan Ren Chao 1968. ''Language and symbolic systems''. Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;
#A language has rules which are shared by a community.
#All human languages are based on [[sound]] and [[hearing]], or in the case of [[sign language]], [[Sight|vision]]. All the basic sound units, or [[phoneme]]s, have this in common: they can be spoken by the human [[voice]], and heard by the human [[ear]].
#The sounds come out in a [[sequence]], not all at once. This is mimicked in writing, where the marks are put on the paper or screen in the same sequence.
#The stream of sounds have little gaps between them, and come in bigger packages. We call the bigger packets [[sentence]]s or [[question]]s or replies or comments.
#In most languages, [[English language|English]] being one, the order of the words can change the meaning: &quot;the cat sat on the man&quot; is different from &quot;the man sat on the cat&quot;.
#[[Word]]s (which may be made up of more than one phoneme) divide up into two classes: content and non-content. Content words have [[semantics|meaning]]: nouns, verbs &amp;c. Non-content words are there to make the language work: ''and'', ''not'', ''in'', ''out'', ''what'', &amp;c. [[Grammar]] consists of studying how words fit together to mean something.
#All languages have:
## sentences with two types of expression: nouns and verbs: ''Jill is'' here.
## adjectives to modify nouns: ''good'' food.
## ways of linking: sink ''or'' swim.
## dummy elements: Jill likes to swim, ''so'' do I.
## devices to order or ask questions: Get up! Are you ill?
# Most of the languages have a [[writing system|written form]]. Before the invention of recording, the writing system was the only way to keep track of spoken information.
# All languages constantly evolve. New words appear, new form of saying things, new accentuations.
There are many more things in common between languages.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg J.H. (ed) 1966. ''Universals of language''. 2nd ed, MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inheritance ===
The capacity to learn and use language is [[Heredity|inherited]]. Normally, all humans are born with this capability. ''Which'' language is learned by a child depends on which language is spoken by the child's community. The ''capacity'' is inherited, but the particular language is learned.

Children have a special period, from about 18 months to about four years, which is critical for learning the language. If this is seriously disrupted, then their language skills will be damaged. Adults do not learn languages the same way they did when they were young. So if they learn a second language, it is difficult, and they have little chance of speaking it as well as their native language.

Some children have more than one native language like when they live in a foreign country or when their father speaks a different language from their mother.

==Types of language ==
[[Mathematics]] and [[computer science]] use created languages called [[formal language]]s (like computer [[programming language]]s), but these may or may not be 'true' languages. Mathematics itself is seen as a language by many. Some people consider musical notation to be a way of writing the musical language.

[[Chinese language|Chinese]] is the language with the most native speakers in the world, but Chinese is not really a language. It is a close family of dialects, some of which are as different as [[Romance languages]] are from one another.

English is often called &quot;the international language&quot;. It is the main second language of the world and the language of [[science]], [[business]], and [[entertainment]].
:* '''English''' as a first language: 380 million.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal, David 1995. ''The Cambridge encyclopedia of the English language''.  Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p108&lt;/sup&gt;
:* English as an official second language: up to 300 million.
:* English taught as a second language, but with no official status: anyone's guess, up to 1000 million.
:* '''Chinese''' (Mandarin): 390 million native speakers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chao&quot;/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p96&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;850 million claimed by English Wikipedia ([[Chinese language]]) but without specific reference.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some languages are made up so that a lot of people around the world can learn them, without the new languages being tied to any specific country or place. One of the most popular of these languages is [[Esperanto]], which is sometimes called &quot;La Internacia Lingvo,&quot; or &quot;The International Language.&quot; Another of these languages is called [[Volapuk]], which was popular about a hundred years ago but is much less popular now. It has mostly been replaced by languages like [[Esperanto]], [[Interlingua]], and [[Ido]].

Part of the reason that [[Volapuk]] became unpopular is that some sounds are hard to say for people who speak [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or English, two of the most widely spoken languages in the world.

'''Leisure''' (or '''free time''') is when a person can choose what to do. During a person's leisure time, they do not have an [[obligation]] to be at [[school]] or work at a [[job]]. During leisure time, people can do [[wikt:fun|fun]] activities, [[family]] activities, or other non-[[Labour (economics)|work]] activity, such as hobbies.  

Common forms of recreation or leisure are:

* Playing [[sport]]s such as [[football]] or [[ice hockey|hockey]]
* Playing [[game]]s such as chess or cards
* Exercising such as running or lifting weights
* Watching [[television]] and [[movies]]
* Listening to [[music]]
*[[Hobby|Hobbies]] such as playing [[piano]] or [[guitar]], knitting, or sewing
*[[Travel]]ling
* Reading
* [[Book Club]]s

A [[vacation]] or [[holiday]] is the setting aside of time specifically for leisure. During their vacation, some people travel to a different region or country, and stay at a [[hotel]] so that they can do things they could not do near home. Other people prefer to spend their vacation time at home in their own community.

In rich [[developed nations|industrialized countries]] such as the [[United States|US]] and [[Canada]], as well as in most European countries, workers are allowed to stay home on the [[weekend]] (usually [[Saturday]] and [[Sunday]]), and use it as leisure time. People in poorer developing countries usually have less leisure time, as they have to work longer hours and more days per year.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Live''' can be a [[verb]]. It rhymes with &quot;give&quot;. &quot;To live&quot; means &quot;to be alive&quot; (and not dead). If you live, then you have [[life]].
  
It can be used in a general way: 
*&quot;I live in London&quot;. 
*&quot;I live in a house&quot;. 
*&quot;A person can always live in fear&quot;. 

'''Live''' can be an [[adjective]]. It rhymes with &quot;five&quot;.
*In [[television]], a &quot;live&quot; [[Television programme|program]] is one where what is happening can be seen at the same time as it is happening. [[Sports]] program are usually &quot;live&quot;. 
*In [[music]], If a [[Compact disc|CD]] is a &quot;live recording&quot; it means a recording which was made at a [[concert]] with an [[audience]] present. If it is not a live recording it may be a recording made in a [[studio]].
*&quot;Live&quot; can also mean &quot;full of energy&quot; or simply &quot;happening now&quot;. Something that is being talked about in the [[newspaper]]s at the moment can be a &quot;live issue&quot;.

[[File:HumanNewborn.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A newborn [[baby]] is an example of [[life]]]]

'''Life''' is easy to recognize, but hard to [[definition|define]].&lt;ref name=Koshland&gt;{{Cite journal |title=The seven pillars of life |journal=Science |last=Koshland, Daniel E. Jr 2002 |volume=295 |issue=5563 |pages=2215–2216 |doi= 10.1126/science.1068489 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/295/5563/2215 |accessdate=2009-05-25 |pmid=11910092}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of life is called [[biology]] and people who study life are biologists. A lifespan is the [[average]] length of life in a species. 

All known life on [[Earth]] is powered by solar energy. Without energy from the sun no life could exist. All life on Earth is based on the [[chemistry]] of [[carbon]] compounds, specifically involving long-chain molecules such as [[protein]]s and [[nucleic acid]]. With [[water]], which is essential, the long molecules are wrapped inside [[Cell membrane|membranes]] to form [[cell]]s. This may or may not be true of all possible forms of life in the [[Universe]]: it is true of all life on Earth today.

==Summary==
Living organisms are [[Systems theory|open systems]]. They are always changing, because they exchange [[material]]s and [[information]] with their [[environment]]. They undergo [[metabolism]], maintain [[homeostasis]], possess a capacity to [[cell growth|grow]], respond to [[stimulus|stimuli]] and [[Reproduction|reproduce]].

Through [[natural selection]], they adapt to their environment in successive generations. More complex living organisms can communicate through various means.&lt;ref name=Koshland/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chambers&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Chambers 21st Century Dictionary |edition=online |year=1999 |title=organism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many life forms can be found on [[Earth]]. The properties common to these organisms—[[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[fungus|fungi]], [[protist]]s, [[archaea]], and [[bacteria]]—are a carbon and water-based [[cell (biology)|cellular]] form with complex [[organization]] and [[heritable]] [[genetics|genetic]] information.

At present, the [[Earth]] is the only planet we have detailed information about. The question of whether life exists elsewhere in the Universe is open. There have been a number of claims of life elsewhere in the Universe. None of these have been confirmed so far. The best evidence of life outside of Earth is are nucleic acids that have been found in certain types of meteorites&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://astrobiology.gsfc.nasa.gov/analytical/PDF/Martinsetal2008.pdf |quotes= |author=Zita Martins |authorlink= |coauthors=Oliver Botta, Marilyn L. Fogel, Mark A. Sephton, Daniel P. Glavin, Jonathan S. Watson, Jason P. Dworkin, Alan W. Schwartz, Pascale Ehrenfreund |year=2008 |month= |title=Extraterrestrial nucleobases in the Murchison meteorite |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |volume=270 |issue= |pages=130-136 |id= |accessdate=2015-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Definitions of life ==
One explanation of life is called the [[cell theory]]. The cell theory has three basic points: All living things are made up of cells. The cell is the smallest living thing that can do all the things needed for life. All cells must come from pre-existing cells.

Something is often said to be alive if it:
* grows;
* takes in [[food]], uses the [[food]] for [[energy]], and passes [[waste]] products (see [[metabolism]]);
* [[Motion (physics)|moves]], meaning it must either move itself, or have movement inside of itself;
* [[Reproduction|reproduces]], either [[sexual reproduction|sexually]] (with another living thing) or [[asexual reproduction|asexually]], by creating [[wikt:copy|copies]] of itself; and
* [[wikt:reaction|reacts]] to its surroundings
* [[wikt:function|functions]].
* continues to [[existence|exist]]

However, not all living things fit every point on this list. 
* [[mule|mules]] cannot reproduce, and neither can worker ants
* [[virus (biology)|viruses]] and spores are not actively alive (metabolising) until the conditions are right.

They do, however, fit the biochemical definitions: they are made of the same kind of chemicals.

The [[thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] definition of life is any system which can keep its [[Thermodynamic entropy|entropy]] levels below maximum (usually through [[adaptation]] and [[mutation|mutations]]).

=== A modern approach ===
A modern definition was given by [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]] in 1980,&lt;ref&gt;Maturana H. &amp; Varela F. 1980. ''Autopoiesis and cognition: the realization of the living''. Boston: Reidel.&lt;/ref&gt; to which they gave the name ''[[autopoiesis]]'':
#The production of their own components
#The correct assembly of these components
#Continuous repair and maintenance of their own existence.
Roth commented that &quot;In short, organisms are self-reproducing and self-maintaining, or 'autopoietic', systems&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Roth G. 2013. ''The long evolution of brains and minds''. Heidelberg: Springer. p41, 48&lt;/ref&gt; This approach makes use of [[molecular biology]] ideas and [[systems science]] ideas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''law''' is a set of [[rule]]s that people are made to follow by the [[state]]. The courts and police enforce this system of rules and [[punishment|punish]] people who break the laws, such as by making them pay a [[fine]] or other [[punishment|penalty]] or sending them to jail. In ancient societies, laws were written by [[leader]]s, to set out rules on how people can live, work and do business with each other. Today in most countries, laws are written and voted on by groups of elected politicians in a [[legislature]], such as a [[parliament]] or congress. To follow the laws of a society is to do '''legal''' things. An activity is '''illegal''' if it breaks a law or does not follow the laws.

A [[legal code]] is a written code of laws that are [[law enforcement|enforce]]d. This may deal with things like [[police]], [[court]]s, or punishments. A [[lawyer]], jurist or attorney is a professional who studies and argues the rules of law. In the United States, there are two kinds of attorneys - &quot;transactional&quot; attorneys who write [[contracts]] and &quot;litigators&quot; who go to [[court]]. In the United Kingdom, these professionals are called solicitors and barristers respectively. 

The ''[[Rule of Law]]'' is the law which says that government can only legally use its power in a way the government and the people agree on. It limits the powers a [[government]] has, as agreed in a country's [[constitution]]. The ''Rule of Law'' prevents dictatorship and protects the rights of the people. When leaders enforce the legal code honestly, even on themselves and their friends, this is an example of the rule of law being followed. &quot;The rule of law&quot;, wrote the ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] in 350 BC, &quot;is better than the rule of any individual.&quot;

[[Culture]] is usually a major source of the principles behind many laws, as people tend to trust the ideas based on [[family]] and social habits. In many countries throughout history, [[religion]] and religious books like the [[Vedas]], [[Bible]] or the [[Koran]] have been a major source of law.

== Types of law ==
*Contract law sets rules on agreements to buy and sell items and services.
*Property law states the rights and obligations that a person has when they buy, sell, or rent homes and land (called [[real property]] or [[real property|realty]]), and objects (called [[personal property]] or [[personal property|personalty]].
*Trust law(Business Law) sets out the rules for money that is put into an investment, such as pension funds that people save up for their retirement. It involves many different types of law, including administrative and property law.
*Tort law helps people to make claims for [[money|compensation]] (repayment) when someone hurts them or hurts their property.
*[[Crime|Criminal law]] is used by the government to prevent people from breaking laws, and punish people who do break them.
*[[Constitutional law]] is deals with the important rights of the government, and its relationship with the people. It mainly involves the interpretation of the [[constitution]], but also involves things like the [[Separation of powers]] of the different branches of government.
*Administrative law is used by ordinary citizens who want to challenge decisions made by governments. It also involves things like [[regulations]], and the operation of the [[administrative agencies]] that the [[president]] creates.
*International law is used to set out the rules on how countries can act in areas such as trade, the environment, or military action. The Geneva Conventions on the conduct of war and the [[Roerich Pact]] are examples of international law.
*Intellectual Property (IP) law involves the rights people have over things they create, such as art, music, and literature. This is called [[copyright]]. It also protects inventions that people make, by a kind of law called [[patent]]. It also covers the rights people have to the names of a company or a distinctive mark or logo. This is called [[trademark]].

== Civil law and common law ==
'''[[Civil law]]''' is the legal system used in most countries around the world today. Civil law is based on legislation that is found in [[constitution]]s or statutes passed by government. The secondary part of civil law is the legal approaches that are part of custom. In civil law governments, judges do not generally have much power, and most of the laws and [[legal precedent]] are created by [[members of parliament]].
 
'''[[Common law]]''' is based on the decisions made by judges in past court cases. It comes from England and it became part of almost every country that once belonged to the British Empire, except [[Scotland]], and the Canadian province of [[Quebec]]. It is also the predominant form of law in the United States, where many laws called [[statutes]] are written by [[Congress]], but many more legal rules exist from the decisions of the courts. Common law had its beginnings in the Middle Ages, when King John was forced by his barons to sign a document called the [[Magna Carta]].

== Religious law ==
Religious law is law based on religious beliefs or books. Examples include the [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Halakha]], [[Islam]]ic [[Sharia]], and [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Canon law]]. 

Until the 1700s, Sharia law was the main legal system throughout the Muslim world. In some Muslim countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, the whole legal systems still base their law on Sharia law. Islamic law is often criticised because it often has harsh penalties for crimes. A serious criticism is the judgement of the [[European Court]] that &quot;sharia is incompatible with the fundamental principles of [[democracy]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Judgement/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/29AC6DBD-C3F8-411C-9B97-B42BE466EE7A/0/2004__Wildhaber_Cancado_Trindade_BIL__opening_legal_year.pdf Hearing of the European Court of Human Rights], January 22, 2004 (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.echr.coe.int/Eng/Press/2001/July/RefahPartisi2001jude.htm |title=ECHR press release Refah Partisi (2001) |publisher=Echr.coe.int |date= |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Turkish]] [[Refah Party]]'s sharia-based &quot;plurality of legal systems, grounded on religion&quot; was ruled to contravene the [[European Convention on Human Rights|European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]]. The Court decided Refah's plan would &quot;do away with the State's role as the guarantor of individual rights and freedoms&quot; and &quot;infringe the principle of non-discrimination between individuals as regards their enjoyment of public freedoms, which is one of the fundamental principles of democracy&quot;.&lt;ref name=Judgement&gt;[http://www.strasbourgconsortium.org/common/document.view.php?docId=3878], by Christian Moe, Norwegian Institute of Human Rights, published at the site of The Strasbourg Conference (31 pages).&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of law ==
The history of law is closely connected to the development of human civilizations . Ancient [[Egypt]]ian law developed in 3000 BC. In 1760 BC King [[Hammurabi]], took ancient [[Babylon]]ian law and organized it, and then had it chiseled in stone for the public to see in the marketplace. These laws became known as the [[Code of Hammurabi]]. 

The [[Torah]] from the [[Old Testament]] is an old body of law. It was written around 1280 BC. It has moral rules such as the Ten Commandments, which tell people what things are not permitted.

== Judiciary ==
The [[judiciary]] is a group of [[judge]]s who resolve people's disputes and determine whether people who are charged with crimes are guilty. Most countries of common law and civil law systems have a system of appeals courts, up to a supreme authority such as the Supreme Court or the High Court. The highest courts usually have the power to remove laws that are unconstitutional (which go against the constitution).

== Legislature ==
In democracies, the people in a country usually choose people called politicians to represent them in a legislature. Examples of legislatures include the Houses of Parliament in London, the Congress in Washington, D.C., the Bundestag in Berlin, the Duma in Moscow and the Assemblée nationale in Paris. Most legislatures have two chambers or houses, a 'lower house' and an 'upper house'. To pass legislation, a majority of Members of Parliament must vote for a bill in each house. The legislature is the branch of government that writes laws, and votes on whether they will be approved.

== Executive (government) and Head of State ==
The executive is the governing center of political authority. In most democratic countries, the executive is elected from people who are in the legislature. This group of elected people is called the cabinet. In France, the US and Russia, the executive branch has a President which exists separately from the legislature. 

The executive suggests new laws and deals with other countries. As well, the executive usually controls the military, the police, and the bureaucracy. The executive selects ministers, or secretaries of state to control departments such as the health department or the department of justice. 

== Other parts of the legal system ==
The '''[[police]]''' enforce the criminal laws by arresting people suspected of breaking the law. '''[[Bureaucracy|Bureaucrats]]''' are the government workers and government organizations that do work for the government. Bureaucrats work within a system of rules, and they make their decisions in writing. 

'''[[Lawyer]]s''' are people who have learned about laws. Lawyers give people advice about their legal rights and duties and represent people in [[court]]. To become a lawyer, a person has to complete a two- or three-year [[university]] program at a law school and pass an entrance examination. Lawyers work in a law firms, for the government, for companies, or by themselves. 

'''Civil society''' is the people and groups that are not part of government that try to protect people against human rights abuses and try to protect freedom of speech and other individual rights. Organizations that are part of civil society include political parties, debating clubs, [[trade union]]s, human rights organizations, [[newspaper]]s, and charities.
